<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Nuclear medicine physics is a branch of medical physics concerned
with the use of radioactive materials, known as
<strong>radionuclides</strong>, mainly for imaging, but also for
functional measurement and therapy. Nuclear medicine imaging differs
significantly from radiology, in that the radionuclides are arranged to
be inside the patient, either by injection or ingestion as
<strong>radiopharmaceuticals</strong>, and measured from the outside
(rather than passing x-rays through the patient). This creates a number
of complications, not least because the radiation cannot simply be
‘turned off’ once we are done. But it also has some very important
advantages. By attaching radionuclides to biological active molecules,
and then using the radiation to monitor the take up and accumulation of
those molecules in different organs, we are able to perform
<em>functional</em> imaging, giving us much more information than can be
gleaned from the structural imaging offered by x-ray or CT. Similarly,
for therapy, targeted take up of the radionuclide can be used to direct
a radiation dose to the organ we wish to treat.</p>
<h2 id="required-reading">Required Reading</h2>
<p>This section of the module will closely follow the required
reading:</p>
<p>Simon Cherry, <em>Physics in Nuclear Medicine</em>, 4th edition.</p>
<p>This is available in hard copy in the library or to view online as an
e-book: <a
href="https://librarysearch.kent.ac.uk/client/en_GB/kent/search/detailnonmodal/ent:$002f$002fSD_ILS$002f0$002fSD_ILS:1472406/ada"
class="uri">https://librarysearch.kent.ac.uk/client/en_GB/kent/search/detailnonmodal/ent:$002f$002fSD_ILS$002f0$002fSD_ILS:1472406/ada</a></p>
<p>Please follow along with the reading, using the chapter references
given below, as the notes and the lecture slides do not contain as much
detail. These notes are not a substitute for the required reading.</p>
<h1 id="the-nucleus">The Nucleus</h1>
<p>An atom consists of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by a
cloud of negatively charged electrons. Atoms are typically <span
class="math inline">\(10^{-10}\)</span> m in diameter, a distance also
known as an Angstrom, Å. The nucleus contains <strong>protons</strong>
and <strong>neutrons</strong>, which are collectively known as
<strong>nucleons</strong>. A nucleus is typically <span
class="math inline">\(10^{-14}\)</span> m in diameter, four orders of
magnitude smaller than the atom. Protons have a charge of +1e, where
<span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> is the fundamental charge, <span
class="math inline">\(1.6\times10^{-19}\)</span> C. Neutrons are
uncharged. The nucleus has a positive charge of <span
class="math inline">\(Ze\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> is the number of protons. An atom with
a full set of <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> electrons of charge
<span class="math inline">\(-e\)</span> is therefore exactly
neutral.</p>
<p>You will often see masses of nuclei given in atomic mass units, <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(1u =
1.66\times 10^{-27}\rm\,kg\)</span>, although we won’t have much need
for this. More crucially, you will regularly see energies given in units
of <span class="math inline">\(\rm keV\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\rm MeV\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(1\rm\,eV\)</span> = <span
class="math inline">\(1.6\times 10^{-19}\rm\,J\)</span>. You may also
see masses given in units of <span class="math inline">\(\rm
MeV/c^2\)</span>, due to the relation <span
class="math inline">\(E=mc^2\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="nuclides-and-terminology">Nuclides and Terminology</h2>
<p>A nuclide is a specific combination of numbers of protons and
neutrons. For any nuclide we write <span class="math inline">\(\rm
^A_ZX_N\)</span> where</p>
<ul>
<li><p>X is the <strong>chemical symbol</strong> for the corresponding
element</p></li>
<li><p>Z is the <strong>atomic number</strong></p></li>
<li><p>N is the <strong>number of neutrons</strong></p></li>
<li><p>A = Z + N is the <strong>atomic mass number</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, since the chemical symbol allows <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> to be looked up, and <span
class="math inline">\(N = A -Z\)</span>, both <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> are redundant information. So we will
often instead see simpler notations such as <span
class="math inline">\(^{56}\)</span>Fe or Iron-56. Iron has an atomic
number, <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, of 26, and so this
nucleus has <span class="math inline">\(N = 56 - 26 =
30\)</span> neutrons.</p>
<p>We then have certain names for variations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Isotopes:</strong> Nuclides with identical Z and
different N</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Isobars:</strong> Nuclides with identical A.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Isotones:</strong> Nuclides with identical N</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Isomers:</strong> Long-lived excited states of
nuclei.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For nuclear medicine, we are mostly concerned with
<strong>isotopes</strong> and <strong>isomers</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="states">States</h2>
<p>We refer to a nucleus as being in a certain (energy) state. The
ground state is the lowest energy state. Excited states are states of
higher energy which occur usually as the result of a decay or some other
form of excitation. They are usually transient, lasting for a very short
period of time (around <span class="math inline">\(10^{-12}\)</span> s)
before relaxing to the ground state. Of particular interest are
<strong>metastable states</strong>. These are excited states which are
stable for a comparatively long period of time (up to hours or days).
They occur due to complex quantum mechanical rules which make their
decay to the ground state unlikely, but we don’t need to concern
ourselves with that, other than to know they exist, and as we will see
later, turn out to be very important in nuclear medicine.</p>

background only)</strong></em></p>
<h1 id="radioactive-decay">Radioactive Decay</h1>
<p>While there are only 118 different elements (different values of
atomic number, Z) there are over 3000 nuclides (with different values of
N and/or Z) that have been experimentally observed, with around 330
occurring naturally. Of these around 250 are stable, in the sense that
they do not decay over timescales comparable to the age of the universe.
The nuclides found naturally correspond to only around 90 elements. That
is to say that the list of stable nuclides includes isotopes of many
elements (same number of protons but different number of neutrons).
Smalls stable nuclei typically have <span class="math inline">\(N
\approx Z\)</span>, while larger stable have <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> slightly larger than <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, i.e. slightly more neutrons that
protons, up to around <span class="math inline">\(N\approx 1.4Z\)</span>
for the largest nuclei, as shown in</p>
<p>In nuclear medicine, we are concerned with unstable nuclei which
decay over time periods ranging from fractions of a second to millions
of years. These are called <strong>radionuclies</strong>. There are many
possible decay types. Alpha-decay (emission of a helium nucleus, 2
protons and 2 neutrons) and fusion (splitting of a nucleus into two or
more pieces) are important for other applications (such as nuclear
power), but not relevant for nuclear medicine. We are most interested in
the following:</p>
<h2 id="beta-minus-decay">Beta Minus Decay</h2>
<p>Beta minus decay (<span class="math inline">\(\beta^-\)</span> decay)
is the emission of an electron from the nucleus (and also an
anti-neutrino, which does not concern us). This also involves the
conversion of a neutron into a proton: <span class="math display">\[n
\rightarrow p + e^- + \bar{\nu},\]</span></p>
<p>thus changing Z but not A. For example:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{}^{131}_{53}\text{I} \rightarrow
{}^{131}_{54}\text{Xe} + e^- +\bar{\nu}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\beta^-\)</span> decay decay is not
useful for imaging as the electrons are absorbed typically within a few
millimetres in tissue, delivering an unwanted dose to the tissue and not
reaching any external detector. However, some radionuclide therapies
involve <span class="math inline">\(\beta^-\)</span> decay. The kinetic
energy carried by the electron varies randomly, up to some maximum, as
the energy released from the decay is shared with the anti-neutrino.</p>
<h2 id="beta-plus-decay">Beta Plus Decay</h2>
<p>Beta plus decay (<span class="math inline">\(\beta^+\)</span> decay)
is the emission of a positron (and a neutrino). A positron is an
anti-electron; it has the same mass as an electron, but it positively
charged. We have conversion of a proton into a neutron and so a change
in the element. <span class="math display">\[p \rightarrow n + e^+ +
\nu.\]</span></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{}^{18}_{9}\text{F} \rightarrow
{}^{18}_{8}\text{O} + e^+ + \nu\]</span></p>
<p>When the emitted positron encounters an electron (which happens over
a very short distance in tissue, around 1 mm) they two particles will
annihilate. Their mass is converted to energy, in the form of two
photons, each of energy 511 keV, travelling in opposite directions. This
is the decay that is detected in PET (positron emission tomography), to
be discussed in more detail later. The kinetic energy carried by the
positron varies randomly, up to some maximum, as the energy released
from the decay is shared with the neutrino, but this energy is usually
dwarfed by the energy release at annihilation.</p>
<h2 id="electron-capture">Electron Capture</h2>
<p>Electron capture is, in a sense, the opposite of <span
class="math inline">\(\beta^+\)</span> decay. An electron from the atom
is absorbed into the nucleus, converting a proton into a neutron and
neutrino. As with <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> decay, this
changes the element (Z), but not A.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\rm p + e^- \rightarrow n +
\nu\]</span></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{}^{125}_{53}\text{I} + \mathrm{e^-}
\rightarrow {}^{125}_{52}\text{Te} + \nu\]</span></p>
<p>Electron capture leaves a hole in the atomic orbitals for an
electron. This leads to a re-arrangement of the other electrons in the
atomic shells, leading to emission of a series of x-rays or Auger
electrons (electrons which are ejected from the atom after absorbing
energy). Auger electrons are not generally dangerous as they are low
energy and only travel a few nm (the exception being if the radionuclide
becomes part of the cell’s DNA).</p>
<h2 id="gamma-decay">Gamma Decay</h2>
<p>Gamma decay (<span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> decay) is
the emission of a photon (a quantum of electromagnetic energy). Gamma
decay occurs as the nucleus relaxes from an excited or metastable state,
and is the second stage of an initial decay, such as a Beta decay or
electron capture, which tend to leave the nucleus in an excited state.
We can write the combined decays as, for example (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta^-\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma)\)</span>, or (EC, <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>). The relaxation may be directly
to the ground state, or via other excited states, with the latter
resulting in the emission of multiple photons, one for each relaxation.
The energy of each photon is fixed by the energy difference between the
states.</p>
<p>An example energy level diagram for the decay of Co-60 by (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta^-\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>) decay is shown below:</p>

<p><em><strong>Required reading: Cherry 3a,c,d,e,f,g,j (other parts of
section 3 for interest)</strong></em>.</p>
<h1 id="decay-rates">Decay Rates</h1>
<p>Regardless of the type of decay, the occurrence is stochastic - we
cannot determine exactly when a decay will occur, only define the
probability of it occurring within a certain time period. This is given
by the decay constant, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>. As
each individual nucleus has its own independent probability of decaying,
the number of decays in unit time is given by <span
class="math inline">\(N\lambda\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is the number of nuclei. The decay
rate, i.e. the rate of change in the number of un-decayed nuclei, is
therefore given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{dN}{dt} = -\lambda N.\]</span></p>
<p>The negative shows us that the number of non-decayed nuclei decreases
with time.</p>
<p>The solution to this equation, obtained simply by separation of
variables, is <span class="math display">\[N(t) = N_0 \exp{(-\lambda
t)},\]</span></p>
<p>which shows us that the number of un-decayed nuclei drops
exponentially.</p>
<p>We further define:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The activity, A as the number of decays in a sample per unit
time, <span class="math inline">\(A = \lambda N\)</span>. We define 1 Bq
(Becquerel) as 1 decay per second.</p></li>
<li><p>The half life, <span class="math inline">\(t_{1/1}\)</span>, as
the time for half of the sample to decay</p></li>
<li><p>The specific activity, as the number of decays per unit time per
amount of sample (e.g. measured by mass or number of nuclei).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Since the activity depends on the number of nuclei, we also have
<span class="math display">\[A(t) = A_0 \exp{(-\lambda t)},\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span> is the initial
activity.</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(\exp{(-\lambda t)}\)</span> term is
sometimes called the <strong>decay factor</strong>. In practice, tables
of decay factors as a function of time for a particular radionuclide are
often used (rather than half-lives), as this makes calculations quick
and straightforward: to know the activity at a certain time: simply look
up the decay factor for that time and multiply by the initial
activity.</p>
<p>The half-life is related to the decay constant, <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, by <span
class="math display">\[t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln2}{\lambda}.\]</span></p>
<p>It is sometimes useful to know the average lifetime of a nucleus,
which is simply <span class="math display">\[\tau = \frac{1}{\lambda} =
\frac{t_{1/2}}{\ln2}.\]</span></p>
<p>In practice, things are more complicated if the radionuclide can
undergo different decays (known as branches). In this case we can define
a decay constant for each branch, <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda_1\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda_2\)</span>, etc. The total decay constant
is then the sum of the decay constants for each branch.</p>
<p><em><strong>Required reading: Cherry 4a,b,c</strong></em></p>
<h2 id="biological-half-life">Biological Half-Life</h2>
<p>When a radionuclide enters the body, we also consider the biological
half-life, <span class="math inline">\(T_{1/2, \mathrm{b}}\)</span>,
when determining the radiation dose that the patient will receive, or
the appropriate time for imaging. The biological half life is the time
taken for half of the radionuclide to be removed from the body through
normal biological processes. The biological half life is often shorter
than the physical half life, <span class="math inline">\(T_{1/2,
\mathrm{p}}\)</span>, we have discussed above. The combined effect leads
to the effective half life, given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T_{1/2, \mathrm{eff}} = \frac{
T_{1/2,\mathrm{p}} T_{1/2,\mathrm{b}} } { T_{1/2, \mathrm{p}} + T_{1/2,
\mathrm{b}} }\]</span></p>
<h1 id="radionuclides-and-radiopharmaceuticals">Radionuclides and
Radiopharmaceuticals</h1>
<h2 id="what-makes-a-good-radionuclide-for-nuclear-medicine">What makes
a good radionuclide for nuclear medicine?</h2>
<p>When radionuclides are used in nuclear medicine, we refer to them as
<strong>radiopharmaceuticals</strong>. Often, the radionuclide is
chemically attached to another molecule of biological interest. In some
cases this is by direct substitution, either of an isotope of the
radionuclide or a chemical analogue. For example the common PET
radionuclide can substitute for the hydroxyl (OH) group in glucose to
form FDG (fluorodeocyglucose), which is taken up by the body in the same
way as glucose. Alternatively, and more generally, larger molecules,
such as proteins, can be labelled with a radionuclide that is kept far
from the biological active areas of the molecule, and so does not change
its function.</p>
<p>Only a small fraction of possible radionuclides are useful in
practice for nuclear medicine imaging or therapy. There are a number of
considerations as to what makes a good radionuclide, and these differ
between imaging and therapy. In imaging we want to obtain information,
so we care about information getting out of the patient, with as little
radiation dose as possible. In therapy we want to deliver dose to the
area where the nuclide is taken up (we may also want to do imaging to
see where the radionuclide has gone, but that is a secondary
concern).</p>
<p>For the ideal radionuclides, we will consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Decay type</strong>: For imaging, a <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> emitter is needed. <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> emission following electron
capture is preferred over <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>
decay to avoid an unwanted dose. <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> emitters are never used. Positron
emitters have a specified application in PET. For therapy, <span
class="math inline">\(\beta^-\)</span> decay is ideal, because the dose
will be delivered close to where the radionuclide is taken up.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gamma ray energy:</strong> The energy of the <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> ray determines how likely it is to
leave the body without being absorbed. Very low energy <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> rays are also hard to build
efficient detectors for, as it becomes easy to accidentally block them
from reaching the active part of the detector. However, very higher
energy <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> rays are also harder
to detect and impose greater constraints on the detector. In practice,
energies on the order of 50 to 600 keV are practical.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Half-life:</strong> The half-life of the radionuclide is
generally wanted to be in the range of hours to days. Shorter half-lives
makes it impractical to store and administer, whereas longer-half lives
lead to a low specific activity or unwanted long-term dose.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Specific activity:</strong> The higher the specific
activity, the lower quantity of the material that has to be
administered. Low quantities are desired for imaging so as not to
disturb the biological system being studied.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chemical properties:</strong> For many imaging studies,
the radionuclide must be attached to a molecule which is taken up by the
organ of interest. It is therefore desirable that the radionuclide is
convenient to chemically attach to the required molecules, by one of the
methods discussed above.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="production-of-radionuclides">Production of radionuclides</h2>
<p>While some radionuclides occur naturally, these tend to have very
long half-lives (otherwise they would have long since disappeared), or
are being replenished because they are the product of another decay with
a long half life. However, useful radionuclides are not obtained from
natural sources. Instead they are produced artificially, in one of the
following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Nuclear Reactors:</strong> Some radionuclides are
naturally produced as by-products of nuclear fission reactors used to
generate energy. Whether this is practical depends on whether the
particular radionuclide is produced in significant quantities from the
fission of the Uranium-235, and also whether other isotopes of the same
element are also produced (since these cannot then easily be separated
by chemical means). Other radionuclides can be produced by placing
materials in the reactor that will then be bombarded with neutrons,
resulting in ‘activation’, i.e. creation of a radionuclide. <em>For the
exam, you do not need to know details of these production
methods.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accelerators:</strong> An accelerator can be used to
accelerate charged particle, such as protons, to high speeds using an
electric field. They are then allowed to smash into a target, resulting
in the generation of radionuclides. A particular type of accelator,
called a cylclotron, is most commonly used. The ‘cyclo’ part of the name
refers to the fact that the charged particles are accelerated in a
spiral, re-using the same electric field multiple time, which allows for
a much more compact accelerator and higher speeds to be achieved.
Magnetic fields are used to force the charges particle into a spiral
path. Cyclotrons can be used are used to produce a range of
radionuclides, particularly those that decay by <span
class="math inline">\(\beta^+\)</span> and electron capture (since
smashing positively charged particles into the target tends to produce
proton-rich radionuclides that decay in these ways). In particularly,
PET radionuclides, such as are produced this way (see the PET section
for more details). Since these radionuclides often have short half-lives
(e.g. is 109 minutes), a network of cyclotrons is required to supply
hospitals (for example there are around 20 in the UK). <em>For the exam,
you do not need to know details of these production
methods.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Generators:</strong> A generator is a device which stores
a parent radionuclide which decays into a daughter radionuclide, which
is the radionuclide we want to use. Generators are small and can be kept
at hospital sites As long as the parent radionuclide has a longer
half-life, this means that less regular deliveries to the hospital are
required. <em>For the exam, you should know the basic ideas behind the
Molybdenum generator, discussed below.</em></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tc-99m">Tc-99m</h2>
<p>Technicium 99-m (Tc-99m) is by far the most commonly used
radionuclide in nuclear medicine imaging (outside of PET) and so
deserves some particular attention. It is a metastable state, i.e. an
isomer, of Tc-99, which is indicated by the ‘m’. The energy level
diagram for the its production from Mo-99 (Molybdenum) is shown
below.</p>
<figure>
<img src="figs/mo_decay.png" />
</figure>
<p>Tc-99m has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tc-99m decays to Tc-99 with a half life 6 hours. This is long
enough to allow time for the radiopharmaceutical to be injected and
taken up by the organ of interest before imaging, but short enough that
the patient will no longer be radioactive within a day or so.</p></li>
<li><p>Tc-99m has a biological half life of, typically, less than 3
hours, and so the radiation dose to the patient is even lower than the
physical half life would suggest.</p></li>
<li><p>The decay product, ground state Tc-99, is a radioactive <span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> emitter, but with a half-life of
210,000 years and so does not present any residual radiation hazard in
the small quantities involved.</p></li>
<li><p>Tc-99m decays primarily by emission of a single <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> ray with an energy of 140 keV.
This is comparable to the energies used in radiology, and is in the
ideal range for detectability whilst minimising patient dose.</p></li>
<li><p>While Tc-99m cannot be stored in hospitals for long periods due
to the 6 hour half-life, it can be produced on site using a Molybdenum
generator, discussed in more detail below. This avoids the need for
daily delivery (as is the case for most PET radionuclides, for
example).</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="molybdenum-generator">Molybdenum generator</h3>
<p>A Molybdenum generator is a small device which can be used to produce
Tc-99m locally, e.g. at a hospital. The generator contains Molybdenum-99
in the form of the ion <span class="math inline">\(\rm
MoO^{2-}_4\)</span> or molybdate. This is bound to an alumina column.
Mo-99 decays to Tc-99m with a half life of 66 hours. The decay product
is in the form of <span class="math inline">\(\rm ^{99m}TcO^-_4\)</span>
(pertechnate) which does not bind to the column as strongly as molybdate
and can be eluated (washed out) by passing saline (salt water) over the
column, with an efficiency of over 80%. The same generator can be used
many times, once the pertechnate has been allowed to build up again
through decay of the remaining Mo-99. After about a week, remaining
activity of Mo-99 is too low, and the generator is replaced.</p>
<p>If the Tc-99m is not eluted, it would not build up indefinitely,
because the Tc-99m is also decaying. This results in a steady state
(technically known as a transient equilibrium) maximum quantity of
Tc-99m in the generator after about 24 hours. This makes the generator
ideal for daily elution for use for the day’s nuclear medicine studies,
although more regular elutions can be performed if needed.</p>
<p>The generator will also contain Tc-99, due to the decay of Tc-99m.
This is washed out along with the Tc-99m, resulting in a lower specific
activity, particularly if the generator is left for a few days. Regular
elution is therefore needed to maintain a high specific activity.</p>
<p>The Mo-99 is made in a nuclear reactor by neutron activation of
U-238. Special facilities are then required to extract the Mo-99
<em>(For the exam, you don’t need to know the details of this)</em>.
This is only performed at a handful of sites worldwide. In 2009-12, two
of the reactors producing Mo-99 were temporarily shut down at the same
time, resulting a major worldwide shortage of Mo-99 and hence Tc-99m</p>

<h3 id="producing-the-radiopharmaceutical">Producing the
radiopharmaceutical</h3>
<p>For most studies using Tc-99m, the Tc-99m eluted from the generator
has to be bound to a biological molecule relevant to the imaging study
forming a complex. For example, for a bone scan, Tc-99m can be bound to
diphosphonate. The complexes can be made up in the hospital
radiopharamcy using pre-prepared kits, to which the eluted Tc-99m is
added.</p>
<h1 id="gamma-cameras">Gamma Cameras</h1>
<p>The gamma camera is the workhorse of nuclear medicine. Its purpose is
to perform radionuclide imaging, i.e. to obtain an image showing the
distribution of the radioactive tracer inside the body. This is also
known as <strong>scintigraphy</strong>, and gamma camera are sometimes
referred to as <strong>Anger cameras</strong> after their inventor.
Gamma cameras can be used to generate both <strong>planar</strong> (i.e.
2D) scans as well as 3D tomograms, in which case this is referred to as
<strong>SPECT</strong> (single photon emission computed tomography).</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-gamma-cameras">Overview of Gamma Cameras</h2>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>- rays can be detected by
a combination of a scintillation crystal, a light guide and
photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). A scintillator is a material that absorbs
<span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-ray radiation and emits
(multiple) photons of visible light. The amount of light emitted is
proportional to the energy of the <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-ray. The scintillators in gamma
cameras are usually made from from Thallium-doped Sodium Iodide NaI(Tl).
A simplified diagram of a gamma camera head is shown below:</p>
<figure>
<img src="figs/camera.png" style="width:8cm" />
</figure>
<p>Light emitted from the scintillator is amplified in the
photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). A PMT has an entrance window containing a
photoemissive material which is connected to a power-supply so that it
is negatively charged - i.e. it is a <strong>photocathode</strong>. It
will emit an electron when struck by a photon of light. Inside the tube,
the electron is accelerated towards a series of increasingly positively
charged plates, called <strong>dynodes</strong>. When it strikes the
first plate, the electron causes the emission of more electrons, known
as secondary electrons. Each of these secondary electrons is accelerated
towards the next plate, causing more emissions, and so on. The end
result is a large shower of electrons arriving at the end of the tube
where they strike the most charged plate, the <strong>anode</strong>,
and create an electric current.</p>
<p>Each plate multiplies the number of electron by around a factor of
3-6, and there are usually 10 or more plates in total, meaning that the
initial electron created by the single photon results in hundreds of
thousand to millions of electrons striking the anode and generating a
large current. In this way, the PMT is sensitive to the single photon
level. A simplified diagram of a PMT is shown below:</p>
<figure>
<img src="figs/PMT.png" style="width:8cm" />
</figure>
<h2 id="positional-determination">Positional Determination</h2>
<p>The PMTs may be joined to the scintillator via a simple transparent
window, or in some cases a plastic light guide that increases efficiency
of the coupling of light into the PMTs. The PMTs do not work like pixels
in a camera; there are only a few 10s of PMTs in a typical detector
head, which would give very poor resolution. Instead, we rely on the
fact that when a <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-ray is
absorbed in the scintillator, it produces a cone of visible phones that
will be detected by more than one PMT. By looking at the relative signal
level in multiple PMTs, we can identify the location of the <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-ray detection in the scintillator.
This is illustrated for a simplified 2D case below:</p>
<figure>
<img src="figs/pmt_pos.png" style="width:5cm" />
</figure>
<p><span class="math inline">\(S_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(S_2\)</span> are the signal levels from the two
PMTs. The position of the detection relative to the mid-point between
the two PMTS is then given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{x}{h} = \frac{S_2 - S_1}{S_2 +
S_1}\]</span></p>
<p>This assumes that the signal level is inversely linearly proportional
to the distance. It turns out this isn’t quite true, and so uniformity
corrections need to be applied (discussed later)</p>
<h2 id="collimator">Collimator</h2>
<p>Gamma cameras must be fitted with a collimator in order to obtain
useful images. A collimator is a sheet of material that is strongly
absorbing of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-rays, usually
lead, with holes. The walls between the holes are called
<strong>septa</strong>. Without a collimator, points on the patient are
not imaged onto the camera, as illustrated below:</p>
<figure>
<img src="figs/collimator.png" style="width:12cm" />
</figure>
<p>Without a collimator, a point source of radiation would simply result
in a large ‘blob’ on the detector. The collimator ensures that only
<span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-rays travelling
approximately perpendicular to the camera can reach the scintillator,
thus restoring a mapping between distribution of radionuclide in the the
patient and the camera. This is similar to the function of a lens in a
camera (we cannot make a lens for <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-rays). Since most of the <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-rays will not be travelling
perpendicular to the collimator, they will be absorbed by the septa, and
so the efficiency of detection is very low.</p>
<h2 id="resolution">Resolution</h2>
<p>The resolution of the images depends on both the <strong>intrinsic
resolution</strong> of the gamma camera, and the resolution of the
collimator. The combined or <strong>system resolution</strong> is given
by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[R_{sys}^2 = R_{int}^2 +
R_{coll}^2\]</span></p>
<p>and hence is always worse than both.</p>
<p>The intrinsic resolution is the ‘spread’ due to effects within the
camera itself. For example, the finite thickness of the scintillator
means that there is uncertainty over where the visible photons are
originating from, and also leads to the possibility of scatter, changing
the apparent source of the <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-ray. However, a certain degree of
thickness is required for efficient detection. The intrinsic resolution
is usually on the order of a few millimetres.</p>
<p>From geometrical considerations, the resolution of the collimator is
given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[R_{coll} = d\bigg(\frac{l + b}{l}
\bigg)\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> is the length of the
septa wall, <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is the size of the
hole and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the distance of the
patient from the collimator. This is illustrated below:</p>
<figure>
<img src="figs/coll_res.png" style="width:4cm" />
</figure>
<p>Notice that the resolution is strongly dependent on the distance of
the patient from the collimator. That is why the patient is always
positioned as close as possible to the camera.</p>
<p>If the septal walls are too thin, some <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-rays happen to penetrate the wall,
again degrading resolution. In practice we cannot make the septal walls
too thick, as this will eventually reduce the number of detected <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-rays to too low a level, and so
there is again a trade-off between signal level (and hence scan time)
and resolution. Since the probability of gamma rays penetrating the
septa depends on their energy, this trade-off varies with decay energy.
A gamma camera will therefore come with several sets of collimators
which are exchanged depending on the radionuclide being imaged and the
aims of the study. These have names such as LEHR (low-energy,
high-resolution), LEAP (low-energy, all purpose), MEHR (medium-energy,
high resolution) and so on. (You don’t need to know the details of
these).</p>
<p>In addition to having collimators with parallel septa, collimators
have also been designed with diverging or converging septa, or using a
pinhole. (Again, you don’t need to know the details of these.)</p>
<h2 id="pulse-height-discrimination">Pulse Height Discrimination</h2>
<p>It will often happen that <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-rays will scatter within the body
(or the camera itself) and hence change direction. This degrades the
image, as the apparent origin of the <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-ray is no longer the real location
of the radionuclide. In general, there are large amounts of scattering
when using low energy emitters such as Tc-99m, which would tend to lead
to large background signal that obscures the real signal of
interest.</p>
<p>This problem can be mitigated by exploiting the fact that at the
energies used in nuclear medicine, Compton scattering dominates over
elastic scattering, i.e. the <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-rays lose energy when they
scatter. Hence, by only counting detections within an energy window
around the known decay energy, scattered <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-ray detections can be rejected.
Typically a window size of around 10% - 20% of the peak energy is
used.</p>
<h2 id="uniformity">Uniformity</h2>
<p>It is critical that the gamma camera produced images that are uniform
- i.e. a uniform distribution of radionuclide must give a uniform image.
This can be tested by imaging either a point source of radiation (e.g. a
syringe) with the collimators removed (intrinsic uniformity) or a sheet
of radioactive material with the collimators fitted (extrinsic
uniformity). The images can then be used to calibrate out any
non-uniformities - i.e. to generated a correction that will be applied
to future images.</p>
<p><em><strong>Required reading: Cherry Sections 13, 14A, 14B (in

know details.)</strong></em></p>
<h1 id="spect">SPECT</h1>
<p>To obtain 3D images, the gamma camera is sequentially positioned at
different angles around the patient, collecting a gamma camera image at
each location. The number of positions depends on the study, but 50-100
is typical. The camera camera can either sit at each position for some
time, usually 10s of seconds, called ‘step and shoot’, or (less
commonly) rotate continuously. To speed this process up, most
SPECT-enabled cameras come with two heads, positioned on opposite sides
of the patient, and some specialist machines come with three.</p>
<p>The multiple projections are then processed to generate a 3D volume
or tomogram. This can be done using the same filtered-back-projection
algorithms as used in CT. The concept of back-projection is that we take
the first projection (which is the integral of the activity along lines
perpendicular to the colliamtor) and assume that the radiation was
equally distributed along the line. We then take the second projection,
do the same, and then add the results to the first back-projection. If
we do this for each projection, we end up with an approximation to the
original distribution of radiation, as illustrated below.</p>
<figure>
<img src="figs/backproj.png" style="width:14cm" />
</figure>
<p>Back-projection tends to amplify low spatial frequencies, resulting
in a ‘blurred’ image, and so better results are obtained by applying a
high pass filter to each projection prior to back-projection. The
results of applying a simple ramp filter are shown below. In practice, a
more sophisticated filters that attenuate high frequencies and artefacts
can be used. Artefacts can also be reduced by increasing the number of
projections, at the cost of acquisition time.</p>
<figure>
<img src="figs/filter.png" style="width:10cm" />
</figure>
<p>For nuclear medicine in particular, better results can usually be
obtained using iterative methods. The general idea is that we start with
an initial guess for the distribution of the radionuclides (e.g. by
taking the result of back-projection), and then we ‘forward-project’ -
we simulate the expected projections seen on the gamma camera. Since
these will not match, we then perturb the distribution of radiation and
see if this results in a better match. If it does, then we continue to
perturb in the same ‘direction’. This process continues until a stable
solution is found. The details of this are quite complex and are not
needed for this module.</p>
<p>An important difference between SPECT and CT is that, unlike CT,
SPECT does not change the radiation dose that the patient receives.
However, many SPECT enabled gamma cameras can also generate CT images.
These are useful both to relate the SPECT images to the patient anatomy,
and can also be used for attenuation correction, i.e. to adjust the
SPECT tomograms to account for the fact that different parts of the body
will absorb differing fraction of the <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-rays prior to the camera.</p>
<p><em><strong>Required reading: Cherry 16A, 16B (in outline), 16C,D
(for background only)</strong></em></p>
<h1 id="pet">PET</h1>
<p>PET also provides tomographic images, but works in a fundamentally
different way to SPECT. It works using positron emitters, such as
Fluorine-18. As discussed previously, positrons annihilate with an
electron within a short distance of emission, resulting in to <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-rays that must travel in opposite
directions in order conserve momentum, and each carry 511 keV of energy.
PET uses a ring of detectors to detect both of these photons, known as
‘co-incidence detection’. We then know that the emission was somewhere
along the straight line between the two detections, as illustrated
below:</p>
<figure>
<img src="figs/pet1.png" style="width:14cm" />
</figure>
<p>Collecting a large number of such co-incidences effectively produces
projections, in a conceptually similar way to SPECT. Tomographic
reconstruction can then be performed. The patient is moved through the
ring of detectors on a bed, to allow some or all of the body to be
imaged. Again, a CT image will often also be acquired by the same
machine (PET-CT).</p>
<p>There are several sources of positional error in PET that effect
resolution and/or increase noise over what we might expect:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Non-colinearity: As the positron will have some energy and
momentum prior to annihilation, the <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-rays do not travel at exactly
<span class="math inline">\(180^0\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Positron travel distance: The positron will travel a short
distance (up to 1 or 2 mm) before annihilation, and so we do not detect
the real positron of the emission.</p></li>
<li><p>Scattering: Scattering of <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-rays will obscure the true source
and hence the location of the emission. Since this is mostly Compton
scattering (i.e. there is an ernergy loss), in principle these could be
rejected by energy discrimination. However, the poor energy resolution
of most PET detectors means that small angle scattering is hard to
remove.</p></li>
<li><p>Random co-incidences: <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-rays arriving from two unrelated
decays arriving at the detector ring within the co-incidence time window
results in spurious detections.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These four effects are illustrated below:</p>
<figure>
<img src="figs/pet_error.png" style="width:14cm" />
</figure>
<h2 id="pet-detectors">PET Detectors</h2>
<p>The detectors in a PET camera use a similar principle to a gamma
camera: a scintillator and PMTs, as shown below. Each segment of the
detector would typically contain 4 PMTs and runs independently of the
other segments in the ring. Positional detection using the 4 PMTs
(similar to a gamma camera) gives a positioning resolution which is
smaller than the size of the segment. The scintillator is chosen to
optimise for 511 keV, often bismuth germanate (BSO) rather than the
NaI(Tl) used in most gamma cameras.</p>
<figure>
<img src="figs/pet_detector.png" style="width:8cm" />
</figure>
<h2 id="fdg">FDG</h2>
<p>The most common radiopharmaceutical used for PET imaging is
Fluorodeoxyglucose, or FDG. This is an analogue of glucose, with one of
the hydroxyl groups replaced with radioactive F-18. Glucose, and FDG, is
taken up at sites of increased metabolic activity, which include sites
of tumour growth, as well as in the brain. FDG is therefore often use
for cancer staging and functional brain scans.</p>
<p>F-18, as a positron emitter, is produced in a cyclotron and has a
half-life of 110 minutes. A hospital therefore either needs a cyclotron
on-site, or regular (at least daily) deliveries.</p>
<h2 id="time-of-flight-pet">Time of Flight PET</h2>
<p>A more recent development of PET is known as time-of-flight or
TOF-PET. In TOF, the difference in the arrival times between the two
<span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-rays is used infer
additional information about the position of the decay. If
time-resolution was arbitrarily good, this would allow tomographic
reconstruction directly. In practice, TOF-PET detectors have a
time-resolution of around 500 ps in the best case, which serves only to
localise to around 15 cm. However, this additional information can be
used to help constrain the iterative reconstruction, leading to higher
quality (i.e. less noisy) reconstructions.</p>

<h1 id="radioiodine-therapies">Radioiodine Therapies</h1>
<p>Radioactive iodine, in the form of I-131, is used for treatment of
the thyroid.</p>
<h2 id="iodine-131">Iodine-131</h2>
<p>Iodine-131 is a major product of nuclear fission of U-235 and
Plutonium, and so is produced in significant quantities in both nuclear
reactors and in nuclear weapons. It was one of the major hazards
following Chernobyl, and from above-ground nuclear weapons tests prior
to 1963. However, as fission products are difficult to recover and
separate, I-131 for therapeutic use is usually produced from neutron
bombardment of a Tellurium target in a nuclear reactor.</p>
<p>I-131 decays to Xe-131, mostly by <span
class="math inline">\(\beta^-\)</span> emission, with a
<strong>half-life of 8 days</strong>. There is also a 364 keV <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-emission. This is not useful for
the therapy, and is a radiation hazard, but it can be used for imaging
to check take-up. I-131 is not used for imaging alone, I-123 is a better
alternative.</p>
<h2 id="the-thyroid">The Thyroid</h2>
<p>The thyroid is a gland in the neck, close to the trachea and larynx.
The thyroid produces the hormone <strong>thyroxine</strong>, which among
other things controls the body’s metabolic rate. Unusually, the
thyroxine molecule contains iodine, and so iodine in human diets is
efficiently transported to the thyroid. Oral administration of I-131
therefore results in a large radiation dose to the thyroid via <span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-emission, and only a limited dose
elsewhere in the body.</p>
<p>I-131 is used for treatment of two conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Hyperthyroidism:</strong> An overactive thyroid leads to
a higher metabolic rate than normal, with symptoms including
rapid/irregular heartbeat, hunger, weight loss, etc. It is often caused
by Graves’ disease, an immune system disorder. Treatment with
(typically) 300 MBq of I-131 results in a permanent reduction in the
rate of thyroxine produced. The consequence may be an under-active
thyroid, but this is easily managed by taking oral thyroxine.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Thyroid Cancer:</strong> Following surgical removal of
the thyroid, remaining thyroid tissue can be destroyed using a larger
dose, typically 2 GBq, of I-131.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="radiation-protection">Radiation Protection</h2>
<p>I-131 therapy, particularly the larger dose used for cancer
treatment, represents a significant radiation protection challenge. The
body clears the I-131 reasonably quickly, with a biological half-life of
around a day, but it may still take several days for the patient to have
an activity low enough for them to leave an isolation room (usually set
at 800 MBq in the UK).</p>
<p>The retained activity in the patient can be estimated using a
dosemeter at regular intervals. This doesn’t measure activity directly,
but since the activity just after ingestion is known, a reading at this
point allows future readings to be converted to an estimate of the
activity. This relies on the measurements being made in a consistent way
(e.g. with the dosemeter placed 1 m from the patient), and is subject to
many uncertainties, including the redistribution of the I-131 around the
body.</p>
<p>The isolation room is specially prepared for the patient, including
covering items and surfaces in disposable plastic sheeting, to prevent
contamination. It is important to note that as the physical half life of
I-131 is 8 days, any contaminated items will remain radioactive for
longer than the patient. Once the patient is released, the plastic
sheeting can be moved to a decay store, where it is kept until the
activity is low enough for it to be disposed of in the normal waste
stream. During the patient’s stay, contact with staff and visitors is
kept to a minimum, while always maximising the distance to minimise the
dose they will receive.</p>
