<h1 class="title">Section 3 - Optical Instruments</h1>

</header>
<p>In this chapter we will apply the principles of geometrical optics to
the study of three instruments: a simple magnifier, a microscope and a
refracting telescope.</p>
<h1 id="the-simple-magnifier">The Simple Magnifier</h1>
<p>Let’s consider the eye to be a simple system, consisting of a thin
converging lens (eye lens + cornea) and a screen (the retina). The
distance from the lens to the retina is fixed, but the focal length of
the thin lens, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, can be changed by
the muscles in the eye (known as accommodation). If the object has size
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> then the size of the image on the
retina, <span class="math inline">\(y&#39;\)</span>, depends on the
object’s distance from the lens, <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>
as shown in Figure <a href="#eye" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eye">1</a>.</p>
<p>Under the paraxial approximation, an object of size <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> subtends an angle <span
class="math inline">\(\theta = y/s\)</span>. In principle we can make an
object as big as we like by bringing it arbitrarily close the lens.
However, this requires <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to be
adjusted, and there is a limit to how far the eye can accommodate. The
closest an object can be brought and still focused on the retina is
called the <strong>near point</strong>, and is comfortably around <span
class="math inline">\(x_{np} = 25\)</span> cm for a healthy eye. The
angle subtended by the object is approximately <span
class="math inline">\(y/x_{np}\)</span>.</p>
<figure id="eye">
<img src="figs/eye.png" style="width:14cm" />
<figcaption>Use of a converging lens as a simple magnifier.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A simple magnifier is a converging lens placed in front of the eye
lens, with an object we wish to view placed at the focal length of the
lens. The lens makes the object appear as though it is at infinity. The
eye can then view the object relaxed, as though it is at infinity, but
the image size on the retina is the same as if the object was placed at
<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. That is to say that the angle
subtended by the object, <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is
the same. Since this angle is now given by <span
class="math inline">\(y/f\)</span>, we can write the angular
magnification of the magnifier as <span class="math display">\[M =
\frac{x_{np}}{f}\]</span></p>
<p>This is also the ratio of the size of the object on the retina when
viewed through the magnifying glass, at a distance of <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, compared to the size if we viewed it
without the magnifying glass, when we would need to move the object out
to the near point, <span class="math inline">\(x_{np}\)</span></p>
<h1 id="the-microscope">The Microscope</h1>
<p>We have seen in Chapter 2 that we can use a simple lens to magnify an
object. We call a lens used in this way an <strong>objective</strong>.
If we place a camera where the image is formed, then we have a
microscope. This is how simple digital microscopes work, although the
thin lens is replaced with a microscope objective which is optimised for
resolution and image quality (which is beyond the scope of this
course).</p>
<p>More traditional compound microscopes, where we can look directly at
the image, require an extra element called an eye-piece. This is because
the image formed by the objective is still quite small, to get it to
fill a decent portion of the eye’s angular field of view we would have
to get very close to it, closer than our eyes can focus. The job of the
eyepiece is to take the image and make it appear as though it is at
infinity, allowing our eyes to relax - the same job as the simple
magnifier. This is done by placing the eyepiece so that the image of the
object is at its focal length, <span class="math inline">\(f_e\)</span>.
This is shown in Figure <a href="#microscope" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="microscope">2</a></p>
<figure id="microscope">
<img src="figs/microscope.png" style="width:14cm" />
<figcaption>Simple diagram of a compound microscope.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For the objective, of focal length <span
class="math inline">\(f_o\)</span>, the linear magnification is given by
<span class="math inline">\(-s&#39;/s\)</span>. However, we may also
write this magnification as approximately: <span
class="math display">\[M = -\frac{L}{f_o}\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is the distance between the focal
points of the objective and the eye-piece. This is called the
<strong>tube length</strong>. This approximation is valid because we
typically want a large magnification, and so <span
class="math inline">\(s&#39; \gg s\)</span>. This means that the object
is quite close to the focal point, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(s
\approx f_o\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(L\gg f_o\)</span>
such that <span class="math inline">\(L \approx s&#39;\)</span>.</p>
<p>The magnification of the entire microscope includes the angular
magnification of the eyepiece (<span
class="math inline">\(x_{np}/f_e\)</span>) and so the total
magnification is:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span class="math display">\[M =
-\frac{L}{f_o}\frac{x_{np}}{f_e}\]</span></p>
</div>
<h1 id="the-telescope">The Telescope</h1>
<p>A telescope is designed to take an object at infinity (or very far
away) and create an image of it at the focus of an eyepiece, which then
allows us to view the object. The effect is to increase the angle
subtended by the object (i.e. <strong>angular magnification</strong>).
This is shown in Figure <a href="#telescope" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="telescope">3</a>.</p>
<figure id="telescope">
<img src="figs/telescope.png" style="width:14cm" />
<figcaption>Simple diagram of a telescope.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We define the magnification of the telescope as the ratio of the two
angles subtended, <span class="math inline">\(\theta_1\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\theta_2\)</span>, which gives:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span class="math display">\[M = -\frac{f_0}{f_e}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Notice that this is angular magnification. In a microscope we have
linear magnification due to the objective, i.e. we create a magnified
image of the object. We then use an eypepiece for angular magnification
of this image. In a telescope, at no point do we create an image of the
object which is larger than the object, or this would require
astronomical telescopes to be somewhat larger than practical.</p>
