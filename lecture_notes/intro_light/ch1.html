<h1 class="title">Section 1 - Light as a Wave</h1>
<p class="author">Mike Hughes</p>
<p class="date">Physics and Astronomy, University of Kent</p>
</header>
<p>A full description of the propagation of light is a complex
endeavour. Light is an electromagnetic wave, and so understanding it
rigorously involves solving Maxwell’s Equations (which you will do in
later Stages). Luckily, for many practical purposes there are large set
of simplifications which can be made, allowing us to predict the
behaviour of light accurately enough to be useful. In these lectures,
after a brief introduction to the wave nature of light, we will
introduce the approximation known as ‘geometrical optics’, treating
light as ‘rays’. This will allow us to model simple ideas such as
reflection and refraction Even geometrical optics can become fiendishly
complex, and so we will largely restrict ourselves to a further
approximation known as the paraxial approximation, which means only
dealing with light rays which move on, or close to, the optical axis.
Despite the apparent severity of these approximations, our picture will
be useful enough to allow us to understand the operation of several
important optical devices, including telescopes and microscopes.</p>
<h1 id="light-as-a-wave">Light as a Wave</h1>
<p>Light is a wave in the electromagnetic field, and so you should
<strong>review the waves section of PH321 before continuing</strong>.
Like any wave, a light wave can be described in terms of its amplitude
(<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>), frequency (<span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span>), wavelength (<span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>), period (<span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span>), and phase (<span
class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>).We also define the wavenumber,
<span class="math inline">\(k = 2\pi/ \lambda\)</span> and the angular
frequency <span class="math inline">\(\omega = 2\pi f\)</span>. Then we
can write an expression for the magnitude of the electric field as a
function of position (<span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>) and time
(<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>): <span class="math display">\[E
= sin(kz - \omega t + \phi)\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> is some initial phase. We could
write something similar for <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, as
it turns out for a travelling electromagnetic wave <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> vary in the same way (they have the
same frequency/wavelength but the oscillations are perpendicular to each
other, at least in the idealised case). This is beyond the scope of
PH322, but you will learn more about it in Stages 2 and 3.</p>
<p>From the equation it is clear that the field varies in both time and
space, so when we draw a wave we need to be clear what we are drawing -
either the spatial wave at a fixed point in time (<span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>), or the temporal wave at a fixed point
in space (<span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>) (see Figure <a
href="#waves" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="waves">1</a>).</p>
<figure id="waves">
<img src="figs/waves.png" style="width:8cm" />
<figcaption>Light waves, viewed at a single point in space (left) and a
single point in time (right)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The argument of the <span class="math inline">\(\sin\)</span>
function is called the phase. This tells us the point in the wave cycle
we have reached at particular point in space and time. This is expressed
as an angle, with a phase of <span class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span>
equivalent to a complete cycle of the wave. After a phase of <span
class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span> we are back where we started, so for
example a phase of <span class="math inline">\(5\pi/2\)</span> is the
same as a phase of <span class="math inline">\(\pi/2\)</span>.</p>
<p>We will talk about the <strong>wavefront</strong> of a wave. A
wavefront is a surface of constant phase. The shape of the wavefront can
tell us how the light is propagating. For example, a planar wavefront
describes a <strong>collimated</strong> beam of light. A spherical
wavefront describes light which is converging from - or diverging to - a
point.</p>
<p>If we have a point source, then the wavefront at a time <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is at a distance <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> from the point, where <span
class="math inline">\(r(t) = c t\)</span>. Here, <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is the speed of light (for whatever
medium the wave is propagating in - more on that later).</p>
<h1 id="huygens-principle">Huygens’ Principle</h1>
<p>Huygens’ principle provides a simple rule to predict the propagation
of a wavefront of light. It is empirical, in the sense that is was
derived by observations rather than than from any fundamental
considerations.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>Each point on a wavefront acts as source of secondary wavelets. These
wavelets have the same velocity and frequency as the original wave. The
envelope of these wavelets forms the new wavefront.</p>
</div>
<p>This says that if we have a wavefront, we can calculate how the
wavefront at some future point in time will look by assuming that each
point on the wavefront acts as a source of spherical waves. We then take
the envelope of these new waves, and that is now the new wave.</p>
<figure id="huygens">
<img src="figs/huygens.png" style="width:12cm" />
<figcaption>Illustration of Huygen’s Principle of planar wave (left) and
spherical diverging wave (right)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Non-examinable Aside:</strong> Christiaan Huygens had no
explanation of why this seemed to be true. In fact the reason can only
be understood in terms of a travelling wave solution to Maxwell’s
equations, and in particular the approximate description of this given
by scalar diffraction theory, which you will be introduced to in
PH604.</p>
<p>The flaw with Huygens’ principle is that it also suggests that there
is a wave running backwards, i.e. there is nothing to encode the
direction of the wave. This problem was later solved by Kirchhoff, but
that is beyond the scope of this course. Suffice it to say that
destructive interference results in the ‘backwards’ wave having zero
intensity.</p>
<h1 id="refractive-index">Refractive Index</h1>
<p>The velocity of light depends on the medium it is travelling through.
It can never exceed the speed of light in a vacuum, <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, that is to say it propagates more
slowly in other materials. The refractive index, <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, of that medium determines the
velocity.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>The refractive index, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, of a
medium is the inverse of the ratio of the speed of light in that medium,
<span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, to the speed of light in a
vacuum, <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[n=c/v\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>By definition, the refractive index of a vacuum is 1. Air is about
1.003, which we often take to be 1 for practical purposes. Water has a
refractive index of 1.4, and glass varies from 1.4-1.7.</p>
<h1 id="dispersion">Dispersion</h1>
<p>For most materials, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> decreases
slightly with wavelength over the visible region. This gives rise to an
effect known as <strong>dispersion</strong>. Since different wavelengths
of light will travel at different speeds in the material, a short pulse
of multi-wavelength light will become spread out. This is the ultimate
limit on how much data can be sent over fibre optics. It also explains
how a spectrum is produced from a prism (see Section <a href="#snell"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="snell">[snell]</a>).</p>
<h1 id="polarisation">Polarisation</h1>
<p>Light is a <strong>transverse wave</strong>, the electric field (and
the magnetic field) is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of
the light. In <strong>linearly polarised light</strong>, the E-field
points negative or positive along a single direction. In
<strong>circularly polarised light</strong>, the direction of the
electric field rotates as the light propagates. In elliptically
polarised light the amplitude of the wave varies as the direction
rotates. <strong>Unpolarised light</strong> is made of up of fields
pointing in all directions.</p>
<p>Unpolarised light can be linearly polarised using a polariser such as
polarising film. The film has a transmission axis, which is the
orientation of polarisaton of light which will be transmitted. If the
incident light is unpolarised then the transmitted light will be
polarised in the same direction as the transmission axis. If the
incident light is polarised then the fraction of light which will be
transmitted is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{I_{transmitted}}{I_{incident}} =
\cos^2 \theta\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>
is the angle between the incident polarisation direction and the
transmission axis. If two polarisers are placed at 90 degrees to each
other, known as ‘crossed polarisers’ then the transmitted intensity is
zero.</p>

<figcaption>Polarisation. The first polariser creates linearly polarised
light. The second polariser changes the angle of polarisation, and also
reduces the intensity</figcaption>
