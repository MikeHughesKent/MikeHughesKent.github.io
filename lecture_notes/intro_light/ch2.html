<h1 id="geometrical-optics">Geometrical Optics</h1>
<p>Geometrical optics is a much simpler way to treat light than wave
optics, but it is sufficient for many applications. We treat light as
‘rays’ which, in a uniform medium, travel in straight lines. At
interfaces these rays can be reflected or refracted, resulting in a
change of direction that can be derived from Fermat’s Principle.</p>
<p>We must always remember that geometrical optics is not physical, in
reality there is no such thing as a ray of light. So we mustn’t take
geometrical optics too far, if we seem to predict something that is at
odds with the wave theory of light then we know that it is the wave
theory of light that is correct. Geometrical optics, for example, has
nothing to say about diffraction. Nevertheless, it is a very useful
model; a great deal of industrial optical design is performed using ray
tracing software such as Zemax and Code V, which for the most part use
geometrical optics.</p>
<h1 id="fermats-principle">Fermat’s principle</h1>
<p>Fermat’s principle is simple to state, but allows us to calculate and
derive a number of important rules in geometrical optics, including the
laws of reflection and refraction.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>Fermat’s principle states that the path taken by light in travelling
from one point to another is such that the travel time is minimum.</p>
</div>
<p>In uniform media, this is equivalent to saying that light travels in
straight lines. When light moves between media with different refractive
indices, things become more interesting.</p>
<h1 id="snell">Reflection, Refraction and Snell’s Law</h1>
<p>When a ray of light hits the boundary between two transparent media
with different refractive indices, the beam is partially reflected and
partially refracted. The angle of the reflected beam is equal to the
angle of the incident beam, when both are measured with respect to the
normal of the interface.</p>
<figure id="snell">
<img src="figs/snell.png" style="width:6cm" />
<figcaption>Reflection and refraction at a surface. For reflection, the
angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence, both measured
with respect to the surface normal. For refraction, the angle of
incidence and refraction are related via Snell’s Law. In the case shown,
light is entering a medium with a higher refractive index, and so
bending towards the surface normal.</figcaption>
</figure>
<div class="definition">
<p><span class="math display">\[\theta_1&#39; = \theta_1\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>The portion of the beam which enters the second medium experiences a
change in direction, known as refraction (providing the ray is not
perpendicular to the boundary). The relationship between the angle of
incidence, <span class="math inline">\(\theta_1\)</span>, and the angle
of refraction, <span class="math inline">\(\theta_2\)</span> (i.e. the
angles before and after passing the boundary) is given by Snell’s
Law.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span class="math display">\[n_1 \sin\theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2
\label{snell}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span> is
the refractive index of the first medium, <span
class="math inline">\(n_2\)</span> is the refractive index of the second
medium, <span class="math inline">\(\theta_1\)</span> is the angle of
incidence and <span class="math inline">\(\theta_2\)</span> is the angle
of refraction. The angles are measured with respect to the surface
normal, an imaginary line perpendicular to the boundary.</p>
</div>
<p>It is useful to remember that as light enters a medium with a higher
refractive index (e.g. from air to glass) it bends towards the normal.
As it goes to a lower refractive index, it bends away from the
normal.</p>
<p>For normally incident light, <span class="math inline">\(\theta_1 =
0\)</span>, the fraction of the intensity which is reflected, rather
than refracted, is: <span
class="math display">\[\frac{I_{reflected}}{I_{incident}} = \bigg(
\frac{n_1 - n_2}{n_1 + n_2} \bigg)^2\]</span></p>
<p>For other angles of incidence, the fraction reflected is dependent on
several other factors, beyond the scope of this course. For light
normally incident on an air/glass interface, the reflected intensity is
around 4%. This means that, in an optical system, every (untreated)
glass surface which light hits results in a 4% loss. In practice,
special coatings can be applied to reduce the reflected intensity to a
fraction of one percent. Or, we may want to make a mirror, in which case
we apply a coating or backing which increases the reflected intensity to
90% or more (depending on how much you want to spend on your
mirror).</p>
<h1 id="total-internal-reflection">Total Internal Reflection</h1>
<p>If we look at Snell’s Law we might notice that, when going from a
higher to lower refractive index, there is going to be some range of
incident angles for which the angle of refraction becomes larger than
<span class="math inline">\(90^o\)</span>. What happens then? At this
point there is no refraction, and all the light is reflected back into
the denser medium. This is called total internal reflection. This has
many important applications, in fact it is the geometrical optics
explanation for how fibre optics transmit light without losses (although
a full understanding of fibre optics requires an analysis using a wave
model of light).</p>
<p>The angle of incidence for which the angle of refraction is <span
class="math inline">\(90^o\)</span> is called the <strong>critical
angle</strong>. For angles of incidence greater than this, there is no
refracted ray. We can find this critical angle, <span
class="math inline">\(\theta_c\)</span> by setting the angle of
refraction equal to <span class="math inline">\(90^o\)</span> in Snell’s
Law. <span class="math display">\[\sin \theta_c = \frac{n_2}{n_1} \sin
90^o = \frac{n_2}{n_1}\]</span></p>
<p>and so <span class="math display">\[\theta_c = \arcsin
\frac{n_2}{n_1}\]</span></p>
<p>Note that total internal reflection can only happen inside the medium
with higher refractive index.</p>
<h1 id="dispersion">Dispersion</h1>
<p>In Chapter 1 we saw that the refractive index of materials has a
wavelength dependence. Now we can see from Snell’s Law that the angle of
refraction will then depend on wavelength. This explains why we see a
spectrum from a prism (or a rainbow in the sky!).</p>
<h1 id="the-paraxial-approximation">The Paraxial Approximation</h1>
<p>In the paraxial approximation we assume that all light rays travel at
a small angle relative to the <strong>optical axis</strong>. The optical
axis is the line running perpendicular to elements such as lenses and
mirrors. Among other simplifications, this allows us to make the small
angle approximation, <span class="math inline">\(\sin \theta \approx
\theta\)</span>. We will see example of this in what follows.</p>
<h1 id="images">Images</h1>
<p>In the following sections and Chapter 3 we will be studying optical
elements used to create images, so it is important to understand what we
mean by an image. If we have an object, it will scatter (or emit) light
in all directions. In order to form an image, we need to collect rays
coming from a particular point on the image, and focus them to a point.
Rays from other points on the object must also be focused to points on
the image plane, with their geometrical relationship maintained. This
allows for magnification and inversion, as illustrated in Figure <a
href="#imaging" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="imaging">2</a>.</p>
<figure id="imaging">
<img src="figs/imaging.png" style="width:14cm" />
<figcaption>Concept of imaging. All rays leaving a point on the object
converge to the same point on the image. Left: no magnification. Right:
magnification and inversion.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h1 id="the-plane-mirror">The Plane Mirror</h1>
<p>When we look at an object in a mirror, we see a <strong>virtual
image</strong> of the object behind the mirror. This is illustrated in
Figure <a href="#mirror" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="mirror">3</a>, where a bundle of rays from an object is
reflected from a plane mirror. For someone looking at the object in the
mirror, the rays appear to converge from a point behind the mirror. This
is the location of the virtual image, and we can find this point by
tracing the rays back, as shown.</p>
<p>The virtual image is the same distance from the mirror as the object,
it is the same way up (i.e. not inverted), and it is the same size.
However, it is <strong>depth-inverted</strong> - a right hand viewed in
a mirror looks like a left hand. Our brains tend to interpret this as a
horizontal flip (because depth inversion is quite a tricky thing to
visualise), but this is an illusion. After all, why would it flip on
one-axis but not the other?</p>
<figure id="mirror">
<img src="figs/mirror.png" style="width:8cm" />
<figcaption>Reflection from a plane mirror. An observer looking at an
object in a mirror sees a virtual image of the object, as though it is
behind the mirror.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h1 id="the-spherical-mirror">The Spherical Mirror</h1>
<p>A spherical mirror is a mirror shaped like part of the surface of a
sphere. We define the <strong>radius of curvature</strong> , <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> as the radius of the sphere which the
surface is part of. If we have collimated rays striking a spherical
mirror on-axis, they will be focused to a point P, as shown in Figure <a
href="#sph_mirror" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sph_mirror">4</a>. The distance from the mirror to this
point is the <strong>focal length</strong> of the mirror, <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. It is given by <span
class="math display">\[f = \frac{R}{2}\]</span></p>
<figure id="sph_mirror">
<img src="figs/sph_mirror.png" style="width:14cm" />
<figcaption>Reflection from a spherical mirror. For an object at
infinity, rays come in parallel and are focused to point <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> at the focal length of the mirror,
<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. For an object at <span
class="math inline">\(O\)</span>, which is further than <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> from the mirror, the rays converge at
point <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, which is also further than
<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> from the mirror.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So, if we have an object at infinity, creating collimated rays, then
an image will be formed at the focal length, <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. If we have an object at a finite
distance, <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, then the image will
instead be formed at <span class="math inline">\(s&#39;\)</span>. These
distances are related by the mirror equation:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{s} + \frac{1}{s&#39;} =
\frac{1}{f}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>The image is inverted and has <strong>linear or lateral
magnification</strong> given by: <span class="math display">\[M =
-\frac{s&#39;}{s}\]</span> The minus sign is to remind us that the image
is inverted. If the object is placed between the mirror and the focal
length, <span class="math inline">\(s &lt; f\)</span>, then there is no
real image. Reflected rays appear to emerge from a virtual image a
distance <span class="math inline">\(s&#39;\)</span> behind the
mirror.</p>
<p>Note that a spherical lens only forms an image correctly under the
paraxial approximation.</p>
<h2 id="derivation-of-mirror-equation">Derivation of Mirror
Equation</h2>
<p>To relate the positions of the image and the object to the radius of
curvature, and ultimately the focal length of the mirror, we start with
the diagram shown in Figure <a href="#mirror_der"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="mirror_der">5</a>. We have an
object at <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> and and image at <span
class="math inline">\(I\)</span>. The point is <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is the centre of the ‘circle’, i.e. all
points on the mirror are a distance <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> from this point. A ray from the object
hits the mirror at point <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, a
height <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> above the optical axis. We
label the angles <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> as shown, and we also identify the
two angles <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> which are equal
as per the law of reflection.</p>
<figure id="mirror_der">
<img src="figs/mirror_der.png" style="width:14cm" />
<figcaption>Set up for deriving mirror equation. <span
class="math inline">\(O\)</span> is the object, <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the point on the mirror that a ray
from <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> strikes, and <span
class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is the point it (and all other rays
from <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>) is focused to. The line
<span class="math inline">\(AC\)</span> is a radial line of the
spherical mirror, from the centre of the sphere <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> to point <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Angle <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is the angle the incident rays
makes with the optical axis, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>
is the angle the radial line AC makes with the optical axis and <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is the angle the focused ray makes
with the optical axis.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>From the triangle OAC we have <span class="math inline">\(\alpha +
\theta + (180^0 - \beta) = 180^o\)</span>. From the triangle CAI we have
<span class="math inline">\(\beta + \theta + (180 - \gamma) =
180^o\)</span>. Eliminating <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>
gives: <span class="math display">\[2 \beta = \alpha + \gamma
\label{beta_eqn}\]</span></p>
<p>From the paraxial approximation, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha =
h/s\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta = h/R\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\gamma = h/s&#39;\)</span>. Substituting
into Equation <a href="#beta_eqn" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="beta_eqn">[beta_eqn]</a> gives: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\frac{2h}{R} &amp;= \frac{h}{s} + \frac{h}{s&#39;} \\
\frac{2}{R} &amp;= \frac{1}{s} + \frac{1}{s&#39;} \\
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>To show that <span class="math inline">\(f = R/2\)</span> we consider
what happens as the object position <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> tends to infinity, which means that, by
definition, the image will now be at the focal point, i.e. <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\frac{2}{R} &amp;= \frac{1}{s&#39;} \\
\frac{2}{R} &amp;= \frac{1}{f} \\
f &amp;= \frac{R}{2}
\end{aligned}\]</span> and so: <span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{f}
= \frac{1}{s} + \frac{1}{s&#39;} \\\]</span></p>
<h1 id="the-thin-lens">The Thin Lens</h1>
<p>A lens is piece of glass with one or both of its surfaces curved in
such a way as to cause light rays to converge or diverge due to
refraction. In what is follows, we use the <strong>thin lens
approximation</strong>, which ignores the thickness of the lens. In
which case, the locations of the object (<span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span>) and image (<span
class="math inline">\(s&#39;\)</span>) for a lens are linked to the
focal length of the lens, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, by the
lens equation:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{s} +
\frac{1}{s&#39;}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>If we have a lens of focal length <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, and we place an object a distance of
<span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> one side of the lens, we obtain
an image a distance <span class="math inline">\(s&#39;\)</span> the
other side of the lens.</p>
<p><strong>Note that <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(s&#39;\)</span> are both measured from the lens
outwards</strong> (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is
measured from right to left and <span
class="math inline">\(s&#39;\)</span> is measured from left to right.)
An object to the left of the lens has a positive <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and an image to the right of the lens
has a positive <span class="math inline">\(s&#39;\)</span>. This is
called the <strong>Gaussian co-ordinate system</strong>. An alternative
system, the Cartesian co-ordinates system, measures everything from left
to right which can actually be more useful when dealing with some kinds
of systems and is used in raytracing software. In this case, the lens
equation would have a minus sign before the <span
class="math inline">\(1/s&#39;\)</span> term.</p>
<p>The focal length <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is fixed for
a given lens, it depends on the curvature of its surface according to
the lens makers’ equation: <span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{f}
=(n-1)\bigg(\frac{1}{r_1}-\frac{1}{r_2} \bigg)\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(r_1\)</span> is the radius of
curvature of the first surface of the lens, <span
class="math inline">\(r_2\)</span> is the radius of curvature of the
second surface, and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the
refractive index of the lens material.</p>
<figure id="lens">
<img src="figs/lens.png" style="width:14cm" />
<figcaption>The thin lens. For an object at infinity, rays come in to
the lens parallel and are focused to a point <em>p</em> a distance <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> from the lens. For an object at
distance <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, which is further from
the lens than the focal length <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>,
rays come in to the lens diverging and are focused to a point <span
class="math inline">\(I\)</span> on the other side of the lens, which is
again further than <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. The distances
from the lens to the object and image are labelled <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(s&#39;\)</span>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A real image is obtained for <span class="math inline">\(s &gt;
f\)</span>. Otherwise there will be no real image, and <span
class="math inline">\(s&#39;\)</span> is negative, with rays appearing
to diverge from a virtual image at <span
class="math inline">\(s&#39;\)</span> (i.e. on the left side of the
lens, as drawn).</p>
<p>The linear magnification, the ratio of the size of the image to the
size of the object, <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, is given by
<span class="math display">\[M = -\frac{s&#39;}{s}\]</span></p>
<p>The minus sign tells us that the image is inverted.</p>
