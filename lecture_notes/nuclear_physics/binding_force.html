<h1 class="title">Nuclear Physics Section 2 - Binding Energy and the
Semi-Empirical Mass Formula</h1>
<p class="author">Mike Hughes</p>
<p class="date">Physics and Astronomy, University of Kent</p>
</header>
<p><em>In this section we begin to discuss how the nucleus is held
together, introducing the concept of the nuclear force and binding
energy. We will then develop a semi-classical model to predict the
binding energy of different nuclei.</em></p>
<h1 id="strong-nuclear-force">Strong Nuclear Force</h1>
<p>The Coulomb force cannot be the dominant force inside the nucleus,
otherwise the positively charged protons would ﬂy apart. We can
therefore assume the existence of some force (which we will call the
strong nuclear force) which overcomes the Coulomb repulsion within the
nucleus. However, this force must be weak enough at the atomic scale not
to interfere with the electron orbits, since we can model these
perfectly well using only the Coulomb potential.</p>
<p>We therefore conclude that the nuclear force has a very short range.
The maximum force is experienced by nucleons separated by around 0.8 fm
and beyond 2 fm it increasingly becomes negligible. At distances shorter
than 0.7 fm it becomes repulsive (stopping the nucleons penetrating each
other). The force seems to apply equally well to protons and neutrons
(otherwise there would be nothing keeping neutrons bound in the
nucleus). In fact, experimentally it appears that the strong nuclear
force attracts protons and neutrons equally to a very high level of
precision.</p>
<h1 id="binding-energy">Binding Energy</h1>
<p>Nucleons bound together in a nucleus are sitting in a potential well.
To pull nucleons out of the nucleus we need to put in energy. Or, to put
it another way, a nucleus is a bound (lower energy) state for this set
of nucleons. The total energy required to completely separate all the
nucleons is the binding energy of the nucleus. Alternatively, the
binding energy is the energy that would be liberated were we to assemble
a nucleus from its constituent nuclei.</p>
<p>If we were to introduce energy in order to break the nucleus apart,
that energy would go into mass. Recall from relativity the relation
<span class="math inline">\(E = mc^2\)</span>. The mass of a nucleus,
<span class="math inline">\(M(Z, A)\)</span>, is less than the mass of
its constituent protons, <span class="math inline">\(Zm_p = Z \times
1.00727u\)</span>, and neutrons <span class="math inline">\(Nm_n = N
\times 1.0087u\)</span>. The difference is the binding energy, <span
class="math inline">\(B(Z, A)/c^2\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[M(Z, A) = Zm_p + Nm_n - B(Z,
A)/c^2\]</span></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[B(Z, A) = c^2[Zm_p + Nm_n - M(Z,
A)]\]</span></p>
<p>The binding energy is plotted for several hundred stable nuclei as a
function of their atomic mass number, <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, in Figure 1. We can see that it
increases with the number of nucleons (<span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>) is a fairly, but not exactly, linear
way.</p>
<figure id="fig:binding">
<img src="figs/b_stable.png" style="width:3.5in" />
<figcaption>Binding energy for stable nuclei as a function of atomic
mass number. Plotted from data taken from:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List of nuclides</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A slightly more interesting plot is the binding energy per nucleon,
<span class="math inline">\(B/A\)</span> (i.e. the binding energy
divided by the mass number), plotted for stable nuclei in Figure 2. The
features now become clearer. For heavier nuclei, the binding energy per
nucleon is just over 8 MeV, decreasingly slightly for heavier nuclei.
For very light nuclei, the behaviour is a little more erratic, generally
increasing with A, but with several outliers.</p>
<figure id="fig:b_stable">
<img src="figs/b_per_a_stable_labelled.png" style="width:3.5in" />
<figcaption>Binding energy per nucleon (B/A) as a function of atomic
mass number for stable nuclei. Except for the lightest nuclei, B/A is
approximately a constant. Plotted from data taken from:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List of nuclides</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The peak of the curve is for <span class="math inline">\(\rm
^{62}Ni\)</span>, an isotope of nickel. However, sometimes <span
class="math inline">\(\rm ^{56}Fe\)</span> - iron - is highlighted as
being the peak; while the <span class="math inline">\(B/A\)</span> value
is actually slightly lower, iron-56 is much more abundant in the
universe than nickel-62 (due to lack of favourable pathways to produce
nickel-62 in stellar nuclear synthesis). Iron-56 also has a smaller mass
per nucleon because less of its mass is made of neutrons which are
slightly heavier than protons.</p>
<p>This B/A peak marks a boundary between two effects - nuclear fission
and fusion. You will learn more about these later, but essentially
fission is the liberating of energy as two smaller nuclei join to form a
larger nuclei, and fission is liberation of energy as a large nuclei
breaks into smaller nuclei. We can see that fusion will only occur for
an end product which is to the left of Nickel/Iron, since combining
nuclei leads to a nucleus with a larger binding energy per nucleon.
Since the number of nucleons remains the same, the total binding energy
is now larger, meaning a release of energy. Fission will only occur to
the right of Nickel/Iron if a nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei,
they will have larger binding energy per nucleon, and so again, energy
will be released.</p>
<p>For any nuclear reaction we can define the Q-Value. This is the
difference between the sum of the binding energy of the nuclei before
(<span class="math inline">\(M_i\)</span>) and after (<span
class="math inline">\(M_f\)</span>) the nuclear reaction, or
equivalently the change in the mass deficit before and after the
reaction. It is given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Q = (\sum M_i - \sum M_f
)c^2\]</span></p>
<p>For example, consider the reaction fusing helium and carbon nuclei to
form an oxygen nucleus:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[^4_2He + ^{12}_6 C \rightarrow
^{16}_8O\]</span></p>
<p>Without worrying about the details of this type of nuclear reaction
(which will be covered later), we can calculate the Q value by looking
up the masses of these nuclei:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    Q &amp;= (4.00260u+12u - 15.99491u)c^2 \\
    &amp;= (0.00769u)c^2 \\
    &amp;= (0.00769)(931.5~\mathrm{MeV/c^2})c^2 \\
    &amp;= 7.16~\mathrm{MeV}
\end{aligned}\]</span> where we have used that <span
class="math inline">\(u = 931.5~\mathrm{MeV/c^2}\)</span>.</p>
<p>This Q-value is positive: the mass of the products of the reaction
are less than the mass of the reactants; the product is more tightly
bound than the reactants; the binding energy is larger. We therefore
have a release of energy. A reaction with a negative Q-value captures
kinetic energy into binding energy. You will use the Q-value when you
study nuclear reactions later in the course, and we will not delve into
it more now. Trying to explain the shape of the B/A curve will be our
next task.</p>
<h2 id="sign-of-binding-energy">Sign of Binding Energy</h2>
<p>In the above discussion we were only really talking about the
magnitude of the binding energy. So is it positive or negative? With
energy, signs and the zero crossing are a matter of convention, but we
can think about the binding energy as being negative. The mass of a
nucleus is less than the mass of its constituents, so we need a negative
energy to give us that negative mass. This is consistent with the
convention that we set the potential energy to zero when two particles
are separated by an infinite distance. As they come together they then
lose potential energy, and so the energy becomes negative. However, when
talking about binding energy we often talk about it as a positive thing,
such that nuclei with larger binding energy are more tightly bound, and
we will adopt this convention in what follows.</p>
<h1 id="liquid-drop-model-and-semi-empirical-mass-formula">Liquid Drop
Model and Semi-Empirical Mass Formula</h1>
<p>The liquid drop model is based on the idea that a nucleus behaves in
some respects like a drop of liquid – thought of as collection of bound
molecules which are in constant motion. From this we can develop the
semi-empirical mass formula, predicting properties of nuclei including
binding energies, mass, stability and decays. The formula for the total
binding energy is made up of a number of terms, each of which has a
physically explainable (or at least plausible) origin, weighted by
constants. Some of these weighting factors can be estimated from
theoretical considerations, but in general they can only be determined
accurately from fitting to experimental data. Hence why we talk about
this as a ‘semi-empirical’ model.</p>
<h2 id="volume-term">Volume Term</h2>
<p>As we saw previously, the binding energy per nucleon is approximately
constant for all but the lightest nuclei, typically 8 MeV per nucleon.
We therefore assume that each nucleon attracts its neighbours only, so
that the total binding energy is proportional to the number of
nucleons,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[B_1 = a_v A,\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(a_v\)</span> is a constant to be
determined. (If each nucleon attracted every other nucleon then this
term would be roughly proportional to <span
class="math inline">\(A^2\)</span> which is definitely not what we
observe.)</p>
<h2 id="surface-term">Surface Term</h2>
<p>A nucleon on the surface of the nucleus has fewer neighbours than
those near the middle. Therefore, nuclei with a larger surface to volume
ratio will have a smaller binding energy. The volume is proportional to
nucleon number, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(A \propto R^3\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is the nuclear radius. The surface
area, <span class="math inline">\(S \propto R^2\)</span> and so <span
class="math inline">\(S \propto A^{2/3}\)</span>. The surface term is
therefore</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[B_2 = -a_s A^{2/3},\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(a_s\)</span> is a constant to be
determined. Note that it is negative since a larger surface area means a
reduced binding energy.</p>
<h2 id="coulomb-term">Coulomb Term</h2>
<p>Protons repel each other due to the Coulomb force. If we have <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> protons then the number of interactions
is <span class="math inline">\(Z(Z-1)\)</span> (i.e. each proton repels
each other proton). Recall the Coulomb force is long range, all the
protons interact, so this varies roughly as <span
class="math inline">\(Z^2\)</span>, unlike the volume term which varies
as <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> rather than <span
class="math inline">\(A^2\)</span>. The strength of the Coulomb force
varies with inverse of separation (squared), and acts between all pairs
of protons, so we expect a <span class="math inline">\(Z(Z-1)\)</span>
dependence. From electrostatics it is possible to show that the
electrostatic energy of a sphere of radius <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> of uniform charge is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[U =
-\frac{3}{5}\frac{Q^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r},\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is the total charge and <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon_0\)</span> is the permittivity of free
space. Using <span class="math inline">\(Q = Ze\)</span> and recalling
<span class="math inline">\(r = r_0A^{1/3}\)</span> gives us
immediately</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[U =
-\frac{3}{5}\frac{Z^2e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r_0 A^{1/3}}.\]</span></p>
<p>However, this seems a little incorrect, since it would still give us
some repulsion when <span class="math inline">\(Z = 1\)</span>, but a
proton does not repel itself. So let’s write (without too much
justification):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[B_3 =-
\frac{3}{5}\frac{Z(Z-1)e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r_0 A^{1/3}}  = -a_c
\frac{Z(Z-1)}{A^{1/3}},\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(a_c\)</span> can be evaluated by
substituting in the constants to be 0.72 MeV. Note that <span
class="math inline">\(B_3\)</span> is a negative term since the Coulomb
force is repulsive.</p>
<h2 id="symmetry-term">Symmetry Term</h2>
<p>If we were to use only the surface, volume and Coulomb terms then we
would expect a nucleus made up entirely of neutrons to be more stable
than one made up of protons and neutrons, since there is no Coulomb
force to push them apart. This is obviously not what we observe. The
next term in the equation, the symmetry term, tries to deal with this by
invoking quantum mechanical arguments. From here on in, the terms are
sometimes referred to as a ‘Fermi gas’ model rather than a liquid drop
model.</p>
<p>Neutrons and protons are both fermions, and spin 1/2 particles.
Pauli’s exclusion principle forbids identical fermions from occupying
the same quantum mechanical state. This influences the nucleons’ states
in the potential well, as only two nucleons (with opposite spin, more on
that later) can occupy each state. But protons and neutrons are
different particles, and so they have their own sets of states.
Essentially, if we were to fill up a nucleus with just protons, they
would fill up the higher energy states more quickly for a given <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> than if we had roughly equal numbers of
protons and neutrons, each filling half as high in their own sets of
states. (We will discuss this more when we talk about the shell model,
for now we should just accept this.)</p>
<p>In general, this means than stable nuclei have approximately <span
class="math inline">\(Z = A/2\)</span>, or roughly equal numbers of
protons and neutrons. This is a very strong factor in the binding energy
for small nuclei, slightly less so for larger nuclei which tend to be
stable with a slight excess of neutrons (due to the closer spacing of
higher energy levels, again we will discuss this more later). We can
capture this <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> dependence with the
following term:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[B_4 = -a_{symm}\frac{(A-2Z)^2}{A}
.\]</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(A = Z + N\)</span> we can also
write <span class="math display">\[B_4 =
-a_{symm}\frac{(N-Z)^2}{A}.\]</span></p>
<p>The physical justification for this form of the <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> dependence may not be so clear, but a
bit of thought (or plotting it out) should convince you that this gives
a term which increases the binding energy for <span
class="math inline">\(Z\approx A/2\)</span> more for lower <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> nuclei than for higher <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> nuclei.</p>
<h2 id="pairing-term">Pairing Term</h2>
<p>Empirically it is found that nuclei with pairs of nucleons of the
same type (e.g. 2p or 2n) have a higher binding energy than nuclei with
one of each (1p + 1n). In fact, there are only 4 stable nuclei with an
odd <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and an odd <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, and they are all fairly small (<span
class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>He, <span
class="math inline">\(^6\)</span>Li, <span
class="math inline">\(^{10}\)</span>B and <span
class="math inline">\(^{14}\)</span>N) compared to over 160 nuclei with
even <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and even <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>! This is not accounted for by the terms
we have introduce so far, so we need to add an additional term called
the pairing term, sometimes labelled <span
class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For odd <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> (either even <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, odd <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> or odd <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, even <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span>), there is no effect, <span
class="math inline">\(\delta = 0\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>For even <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> due to even <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> and even <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\delta =
a_pA^{-1/2}.\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>For even <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> due to odd <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> and odd <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\delta =
-a_pA^{-1/2}\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here <span class="math inline">\(a_p\)</span> is our final constant
to be determined. If you look in older books you may well find this term
written as <span class="math inline">\(A^{-3/4}\)</span> instead (In
fact the justification for this power not being 1 is not obvious, why
does the pairing term become less significant for larger nuclei?)</p>
<h2 id="total-binding-energy">Total Binding Energy</h2>
<p>The total binding energy is the sum of the five terms (volume,
surface, Coulomb, symmetry and pairing):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[B(Z,A) = a_vA - a_sA^{2/3}
-a_cZ(Z-1)A^{-1/3} - a_{sym} \frac{(A-2Z)^2}{A} + \delta\]</span></p>
<p>The constants are worked out empirically by fitting to measured
binding energies of nucleons. A good set of values is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(a_v\)</span> = 15.8 MeV</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(a_s\)</span> = 18.3 MeV</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(a_c\)</span> = 0.714 MeV</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(a_{sym}\)</span> = 23.2 MeV</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(a_p\)</span> = 12 MeV</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Python code to fit values to experimental data is here: <a
href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/MikeHughesKent/nuclear/master?filepath=SEMF.ipynb"
class="uri">https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/MikeHughesKent/nuclear/master?filepath=SEMF.ipynb</a></p>
<p>The first three terms can be understood well in terms of a classical
model of a nucleus. They are often referred to as the <strong>liquid
drop model</strong> by analogy to a drop of liquid which is held
together by molecular forces. The symmetry and pairing terms are quantum
mechanical in nature, and are sometimes referred to as the <strong>Fermi
gas</strong> terms; their origin and will be considered later in the
context of the shell model.</p>
<h2 id="mass-formula">Mass formula</h2>
<p>To obtain the mass of a given nuclei, we now add up the masses of the
constituent protons and neutrons and <em>subtract</em> the binding
energy (because we made it a positive thing) divided by <span
class="math inline">\(c^2\)</span> (from <span class="math inline">\(m =
E/c^2\)</span>):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[M(Z,A) = Zm_p + Nm_n - B(Z,A) /
c^2,\]</span></p>
<p>or,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[M(Z,A) = Zm_p + Nm_n - a_vA + a_sA^{2/3}
+ a_cZ(Z-1)A^{-1/3} + a_{sym} \frac{(A-2Z)}{A} - \delta.\]</span></p>
<h2 id="nuclear-stability">Nuclear Stability</h2>
<p>Stable nuclei have high binding energies and hence low masses.
Suppose we would like to find the most stable nuclide among all those
with the same atomic mass number, <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. For a given number of nucleons, <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, we therefore want a minimum in the
mass (largest binding energy), i.e.: <span class="math display">\[\bigg(
\frac{  \partial M}{\partial Z} \bigg ) _A = 0\]</span></p>
<p>Differentiating the expression for mass w.r.t <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> gives</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[z_{min} = \frac{(m_n - m_p)c^2 +
a_cA^{-1/3} + 4 a_{sym}}{2a_cA^{-1/3} + 8a_{sym}A^{-1}}.\]</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(a_c \ll a_{sym}\)</span> the first
two terms on the numerator are very small, and so <span
class="math display">\[z_{min} \approx \frac{A}{2} \frac{1} {1 +
\frac{1}{4}A^{2/3} a_c / a_{sym}}.\]</span></p>
<p>When <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is small <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{4}A^{2/3} a_c / a_{sym} \approx
0\)</span> and so <span class="math inline">\(Z \approx A/2\)</span>.
When <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> is larger, <span
class="math inline">\(Z/A \approx 0.4\)</span>. This is what we observe
for stable nuclei in practice, and so the model is a good fit. Less
stable nuclei decay into more stable nuclei (i.e. heavier nuclei decay
into lighter nuclei (with the same <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>). This can be achieved by converting a
neutron into a proton or a proton into a neutron (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> decay - more on this later). Heavy
nucleons that are far from the line of stability with excess neutrons
may also decay by alpha emission (2 protons and 2 neutrons)</p>
