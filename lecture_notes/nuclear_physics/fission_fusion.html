<p><em>Finally, we study the principles of nuclear fission and nuclear
fusion, including some applications, and touch upon some modern
developments.</em></p>
<h1 id="fission">Fission</h1>
<p>Larger nuclei, particularly with <span class="math inline">\(A &gt;
56\)</span> (iron), can in principle release energy by fissioning
(splitting) into two or more smaller nuclei with larger binding energy
per nucleon, <span class="math inline">\(B/A\)</span>. We can
distinguish between <strong>spontaneous</strong> and
<strong>induced</strong> fission.</p>
<h2 id="spontaneous-fission">Spontaneous Fission</h2>
<p>Consider U-238, an isotope of Uranium, with <span
class="math inline">\(B/A = 7.6~\rm MeV\)</span>. If it were to split
into two equal fragments, both with <span class="math inline">\(A =
119\)</span>, then the SEMF predicts that they would each have <span
class="math inline">\(B/A = 8.5~\rm MeV\)</span>, yielding a huge total
energy release of <span class="math inline">\((8.5 - 7.6) \times 238 =
214~\rm MeV\)</span>. And yet the half life for this decay to occur
spontaneously is <span class="math inline">\(10^{16}\)</span> years! The
first question to answer is therefore, why don’t all heavy nuclei
undergo fission until they reach Fe-56?</p>
<p>The simplest answer to this question is a similar one to what limits
the rate of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-decay - the
Coulomb barrier. We can imagine the parent nucleus just at the point of
splitting. Each fragment sits in a potential well, and must overcome the
Coulomb barrier to escape. As with the <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-decay, we can estimate the height
of the barrier by considering the point where the two fragments are just
touching. Each has a radius of</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[r = (1.2~\mathrm{fm})A^{1/3} =
(1.2~\mathrm{fm})(119)^{1/3} \approx 6~\mathrm{fm}\]</span></p>
<p>and so the separation is <span class="math inline">\(r_s =
12~\mathrm{fm}\)</span>. The electric potential is then <span
class="math display">\[V = k\frac{q_1q_2}{r_s} =
250~\mathrm{MeV}\]</span></p>
<p>In this case this is sufficiently far above the <span
class="math inline">\(214~\mathrm{MeV}\)</span> energy release (i.e. the
excess energy that the fission products would have) that we might expect
that the probability of tunnelling through the barrier is low, and
indeed this is the case. However, in other cases this is not so clear
cut, and we can find possible fissions that, by this calculation, should
occur readily, but in fact do not.</p>
<p>Greater understanding can be obtained by using the liquid drop model
to consider what happens as the nucleus splits. In order to divide into
two fragments it must first deform and become elongated. Considering the
SEMF, we would expect the volume term to not change (since it concerns
neighbouring nucleons), the surface term to increase (since the surface
area increases) and the Coulomb term to decrease (since the protons are,
on average, more spaced out). The outcome therefore depends on how these
two changes balance. If the Coulomb term decreases faster than the
binding energy increases as the nucleus is stretched then the process
will run away until it fissions. If the increase in the surface term
dominates then the stretching reduces binding energy and so the nucleus
will tend to hold together.</p>
<p>Mathematically, we can approximate the surface area of an ellipsoid
by the first two terms of a Taylor series: <span
class="math display">\[S = 4\pi R^2 (1 + \frac{2}{5}\epsilon^2)\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> is the eccentricity
of the ellipse and <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is the radius
of a sphere of the same volume. The increase in the average separation
between points within the volume (which is relevant for the Coulomb
term) goes as: <span class="math display">\[D = (1 -
\frac{1}{5}\epsilon^2)\]</span></p>
<p>The change in binding energy for a given eccentricity relative to an
unstretched nucleus is therefore: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \Delta B &amp;= B(\epsilon)  - B(\epsilon  = 0) \\
    &amp;= - a_s A^{2/3}(1 + \frac{2}{5} \epsilon^2)  -
a_cZ^2A^{-1/3}(1-\frac{1}{5}\epsilon^2) + a_sA^{2/3} + a_cZ^2A^{-1/3} \\
    &amp;= (-\frac{2}{5}a_sA^{2/3} +
\frac{1}{5}a_cZ^2A^{-1/3})\epsilon^2
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>In practice, regardless of the value of <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>, stretching increases the
binding energy (i.e. releases energy) when <span
class="math display">\[\frac{1}{5}a_cZ^2A^{-1/3} &gt;
\frac{2}{5}a_sA^{2/3}\]</span></p>
<p>Putting in the values for <span class="math inline">\(a_s\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(a_c\)</span> this gives <span
class="math display">\[\frac{Z^2}{A} &gt; 47\]</span> as the condition
for when fission should occur. In practice the condition can be slightly
relaxed, as ever, due to quantum tunnelling, but this nevertheless gives
us a rough estimate. Nevertheless, if we were to put in the values for
U-235 (Z = 92, A = 235) we get <span class="math inline">\(Z^2/A =
36\)</span>, suggesting that spontaneous fission should not readily
occur.</p>
<h2 id="induced-fusion">Induced Fusion</h2>
<p>There are certain nuclei which do not undergo spontaneous fission but
that can nevertheless be made unstable to fission by absorption of a
neutron. The neutron may carry kinetic energy, or may be a
<strong>thermal neutron</strong>, meaning that it carries only the
energy associated with the temperature of the environment (<span
class="math inline">\(E=k_BT\)</span>). Some nuclei, such as U-235, will
fission just from absorbing a thermal neutron. Such nuclei are said to
be <strong>fissile</strong>. Others, such as U-238, require the neutron
to carry kinetic energy. These are <strong>fissionable</strong>, but not
fissile.</p>
<p>Following the absorption of the nucleus, we obtain a <strong>compound
state</strong> (excited state). The <strong>excitation energy</strong>
of this state is obtained from the mass difference between the excited
compound state and the equivalent ground state nucleus. For example, if
U-235 absorbs a neutron, to form the compound state <span
class="math inline">\(^{235}\mathrm{U}^*\)</span>, then the excitation
energy is <span class="math display">\[E_{\mathrm{ex}} =
m(^{236}\mathrm{U}^*) - m(^{236}\mathrm{U}),\]</span> where <span
class="math display">\[m(^{236}\mathrm{U}^*) = m(^{235}\mathrm{U}) +
m_n,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(m_n\)</span> is the
neutron mass. This gives <span class="math inline">\(E =
6.5~\mathrm{MeV}\)</span>, sufficient to overcome the <strong>activation
energy</strong> (energy to overcome to fission barrier) of <span
class="math inline">\(6.2~\mathrm{MeV}\)</span>.</p>
<p>In comparison, for U-238, the same calculation gives <span
class="math inline">\(E_{ex} = 4.8~\mathrm{MeV}\)</span> which is
insufficient to overcome the activation energy of <span
class="math inline">\(6.6~\mathrm{MeV}\)</span>. (The difference can be
understood in terms of the pairing term of the SEMF, since U-235 is
even-odd and U-238 is even-even). The extra energy for fission must
therefore come from kinetic energy of the neutron, hence why thermal
neutrons cannot induce fission in U-238.</p>
<h2 id="fission-products">Fission Products</h2>
<p>A general induced fusion reaction of U-235 looks like:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{n} + {}^{235}_{92}\text{U}
\rightarrow {}^{236}_{92}\text{U}^* \rightarrow \text{X}^* + \text{Y}^*
\rightarrow \text{X} + \text{Y} + \kappa \text{n}\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\text{X}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\text{Y}\)</span> are the decay products and <span
class="math inline">\(\kappa \approx 2.4\)</span> is the average number
of <strong>prompt neutrons</strong> which are released almost
immediately (<span
class="math inline">\(10^{-14}~\mathrm{s}\)</span>).</p>
<p>While we might expect that <span
class="math inline">\(\text{X}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\text{Y}\)</span> would be roughly equal in size,
this is not the most probable outcome. Typically the fission fragments
from U-235 are around <span class="math inline">\(A = 95\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(A= 137\)</span>. The exact reasons for this
are still being worked out, but are thought to be connected to shell
filling effects.</p>
<p>Even after the emission of the prompt neutrons, this decay products
still have an excess of neutrons and hence are unstable. <span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-decay often follows, followed by
further emission of neutrons, known as <strong>delayed neutrons</strong>
as they are emitted around 1 s after the fission. These only make up
less than 1% of the total neutrons emitted, but turn out to be very
useful for fission power generation, as discussed below.</p>
<h2 id="chain-reactions">Chain Reactions</h2>
<p>When a nucleus, such as U-235, undergoes fission, it results in two
unequal daughter nuclei and several neutrons. The neutrons are emitted
because the daughter nuclei have an excess of neutrons (recall that
light nuclei require a smaller excess of neutrons to be stable.). These
neutrons can then be absorbed by other U-235 nuclei, which then fission
and release more neutrons. If, on average, each fission results in the
less than one subsequent fission, then the situations is
<strong>sub-critical</strong> and things quickly stop. If each fission
results in another fission then the situation is
<strong>critical</strong> and we have a stable reaction. If each fission
results in more than one further fission then we are
<strong>super-critical</strong> and we have a run-away reaction.</p>
<h2 id="nuclear-power">Nuclear Power</h2>
<p>To generate power from nuclear fission we would like to have a
stable, self-sustaining, nuclear reaction. We certainly do not want
something that runs away. Most nuclear power is generated using U-235.
Naturally occurring Uranium only contains about 0.7% U-235, with the
remainder mostly U-238 which is not fissile. For most nuclear reactors
the Uranium must be enriched to increase the U-235 fraction to about 4%
using a centrifuge. The waste product from this process, which has a
lower concentration of U-235 and a higher concentration of U-238, is
called <strong>depleted Uranium</strong> and has several applications,
including in armour-piercing shells.</p>
<p>With U-235 it turns out that, by default, the reaction is
sub-critical. Even though several neutrons are produced by a fission, on
average less than one will be absorbed by another U-235 nucleus. This is
because they are created with sufficient kinetic energy that they are
not easily absorbed. We refer to the chance of the neutron being
absorbed as the <strong>cross-section</strong>. The cross-section
rapidly decreases as the kinetic energy increases.</p>
<p>To achieve a self sustaining nuclear reaction we need to slow the
neutrons down, i.e. <strong>thermalise</strong> them. This is done with
a medium called the <strong>moderator</strong>. In a nuclear reactor
this will often be graphite. Neutrons entering this material lose
kinetic energy and then are more likely to absorbed by a U-235 nucleus,
increasing the rate of fission. Layers of the nuclear fuel (Uranium) and
moderator were traditionally referred to as the
<strong>pile</strong>.</p>
<p>The rate of energy generation in a nuclear reactor is controlled by
using the correct amount of moderator. The reaction rate can be fine
tuned by inserting <strong>control rods</strong> of materials such as
Cadmium or Boron which absorb neutrons and hence reduce the rate of the
reaction. However, given the rate of the reaction and the emission of
prompt neutrons, the control rods cannot be inserted or removed fast
enough into a critical pile to prevent a run-away reaction and meltdown.
This problem is solved by designing the pile to be slightly sub-critical
for prompt neutrons. This means that the delayed neutrons are needed for
the pile to become critical. Since these delayed neutrons are slower to
be emitted, the control rods can be moved fast enough to tune the rate
of fission and hence control the power generation. An example of a power
station design is shown in Figure <a href="#fig:magnox"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:magnox">1</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>To generate power from a nuclear reactor we need to somehow capture
the energy released by fission. Almost all of the energy goes into
kinetic energy of the daughter particles, generating heat. Coolant, such
as pressured water or gas, flows through the reactor and transfers the
heat to water which turns to steam and the expansion drives a turbine,
just as in a conventional power station. As discussed above, the fission
products are radioactive and must not be released directly into the
environment. Some of the neutrons will also be absorbed by materials in
and around the reactor, resulting in radioactive products. The whole of
the reactor is therefore enclosed in a containment vessel.</p>
<p>This is all a gross simplification, and you don’t need to know any
more details of how a reactor works for the exam, but for interest there
are links to more detailed resources on Moodle.</p>
<h2 id="nuclear-fission-weapons-not-examinable">Nuclear Fission Weapons
(Not Examinable)</h2>
<p>To create a weapon we want to release as much energy as possible in a
short space of time. We therefore want (a) lots of neutrons emitted (b)
quickly. We therefore want increased purity of the fissile material
(further enrichment), and make use of prompt neutrons. To generate a
high yield, the key is to ensure that as much fission as possible occurs
before the fissile material is blown apart. Approaches include
gun-types, where two masses of the fissile materials are fired together,
and implosion types, where a ring of explosives force the fissile
material together in the centre. Links to more information are on
Moodle.</p>
<h1 id="nuclear-fusion">Nuclear Fusion</h1>
<p>In nuclear fusion, light nuclei (to the left of the peak on the <span
class="math inline">\(B/A\)</span> against <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> plot) combine to form heavier nuclei,
resulting in a positive Q-Value and hence a release of energy. Once
again, we can explain why fusion does not happen all the time by
invoking the Coulomb barrier. This time, of course, we want to bring
positively charged nuclei together, and so the considerations are fairly
straightforward. In order to bring two nuclei together so that they are
touching (and hence so that the strong nuclear force comes into play),
we must overcome a Coulomb potential of <span class="math display">\[V =
k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r} = k \frac{Z_1eZ_2e}{r},\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(Z_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Z_2\)</span> are the atomic numbers of the two
nuclei, and the separation, <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, is
equal to the sum of their radii. For example, to fuse two deuterium
nuclei (deuterons) to form He-4, we would have <span
class="math display">\[V = k \frac{(e^2)}{2 \times r_0(2)^{1/3}} \approx
0.47~\mathrm{MeV}\]</span></p>
<p>From <span class="math inline">\(E = k_BT\)</span> this is equivalent
to a temperature of over <span class="math inline">\(10^{10}\)</span> K!
In practice, quite such high temperatures are not needed. Firstly, while
a certain temperature gives an average kinetic of energy of <span
class="math inline">\(k_BT\)</span>, there are a distribution of
energies, and so some nuclei will have more. Secondly, quantum
tunnelling allows for a non-zero probability of fusion even if the
kinetic energy is below the Coulomb potential. Nevertheless, extremely
high temperature are still required (100s of millions of K for a viable
fusion reactor); such a temperature is difficult to create, but is
present in the core of stars due to the huge compressive gravitational
forces.</p>
<h2 id="stellar-fusion">Stellar fusion</h2>
<p>In nature, fusion is much more important that fission, since it is
the process that drives energy generation in stars. Those of you taking
astrophysics modules will learn about this in far more detail there, but
for this module we will look at the the Hydrogen burning process, the
dominant process in stars that fuses four protons to form a Helium-4
nucleus (also involving some Beta Decays). The first step is the fusion
of two protons:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{p} + \text{p} \rightarrow
{}^{2}_{1}\text{D}  + \text{e}^+ + \nu_e\]</span> releasing 0.42 MeV, or
a total of 1.442 MeV after the position annihilates with an electron.
This reaction is extremely rare, occurring on the order of once every
few billion years (depending on the mass of the star). This limits the
rate of fusion in stars. The deuteron formed in the first step then
fuses with another proton:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{p} + {}^{2}_{1}\text{D}
\rightarrow {}^{3}_{2}\text{He}   + \gamma\]</span> releasing a further
4.493 MeV and a gamma ray. There are several possible routes to form
He-4, including the nost common (84%) fusion of two He-3 nuclei: <span
class="math display">\[{}^{3}_{2}\text{He} + {}^{3}_{2}\text{He}
\rightarrow {}^{4}_{2}\text{He} + 2\text{p}\]</span> which releases
12.859 MeV.</p>
<h2 id="power-from-fusion">Power from fusion</h2>
<p>It has long been a goal to obtain useful amounts of energy from
nuclear fusion here on Earth. This has several potential benefits over
fission:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The materials needed for fusion (light nuclei such as the
deuteron) are more readily available, or can be easily created, compared
with fissile materials such as U-235.</p></li>
<li><p>A fusion reactor would produce much less radioactive
waste.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Although the energy released in a fusion event is generally less than
a fission event (i.e. the Q-Value is smaller), the energy released per
unit mass of the reactants is larger. Therefore power from fusion is
said to be more energy dense.</p>
<p>There is no question that fusion power is possible in principle, as
we know it occurs in stars and fusion weapons, but it remains to be seen
if the conditions for fusion can be generated on Earth in such a way as
to generate stable and safe power at an acceptable cost. It turns out to
be rather difficult to create the conditions for fusion without the
gravitational field of a star to create the required pressure and hence
temperature. (The idea of <strong>cold fusion</strong>, making fusion
happen without these high temperature, is of course, complete
nonsense.)</p>
<p>There have been several fusion reactions proposed as a power source.
In order for the reaction to be sufficiently likely to occur it must,
among other things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Only involve two reactants (probability for reactions between 3+
nuclei are very small).</p></li>
<li><p>Produce two products.</p></li>
<li><p>Conserve protons and neutrons (conversion is possible via the
Weak Force, but too unlikely).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A particularly strong candidate is <strong>deuterium-tritium (D+T)
fusion</strong>: <span class="math display">\[{}^{2}_{1}\text{D} +
{}^{3}_{1}\text{T} \rightarrow {}^{4}_{2}\text{He} + \text{n}\]</span>
which releases 17.6 MeV. Notice that this does not produce radioactive
products intrinsically (unlike fission), but the free neutron may go on
to be absorbed by other materials, activating them. Deuterium is readily
obtained from sea-water, while tritium can be produced by bombarding
lithium with neutrons. This could be done using the neutrons created in
the D-T fusion, known as <strong>tritium breeding</strong>.</p>
<p>To create the conditions for fusion, the reactants must be pushed
together with sufficient energy to overcome the Coulomb barrier. There
are two approaches to this which have been investigated in detail:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Magnetic Confinement - The reactant mixture, once heated, becomes
a plasma (i.e electrons are stripped from the nuclei to leave charged
ions) and so can be directed using magnetic fields in a device such as a
Tokamak.</p></li>
<li><p>Inertial Confinement - The reactants are forced together using
momentum imparted from a high energy laser beam.</p></li>

<p>In practice, the engineering challenges are immense, and no-one has
yet demonstrated anything close to a viable fusion reactor. On 5th
December 2022, a major step forward was made when the United States
Department of Energy managed to achieve 3.25 MJ of energy generation
from only 2.05 MJ of laser energy used to inject energy to the target,
resulting in 1.15 MJ of fusion energy output. However, this ignores the
huge amount of energy required to run the laser, i.e. there was no a
viable way of generating power. Several private sector companies have
attracted large amount of investor funding in recent years, but whether
this means that we are on the cusp of a new source of clean energy, or
simply living through the hype before the next ‘fusion winter’ remains
to be seen.</p>
