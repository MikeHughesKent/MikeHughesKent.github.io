<h1 class="title">Nuclear Physics Section 1 - Nuclear Properties</h1>
<p class="author">Mike Hughes</p>
<p class="date">Physics and Astronomy, University of Kent</p>
</header>
<p><em>This section covers some of the fundamental properties of atomic
nuclei. At this stage we will simply describe some simple properties and
give definitions without any real attempt to explain <em>why</em> things
are this way. In later sections we will try to develop models of the
nucleus that allows us, to a greater or lesser extent, to predict some
of these properties.</em></p>
<h1 id="nuclear-scales">Nuclear Scales</h1>
<p>An atom consists of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by a
cloud of negatively charged electrons. Atoms are typically <span
class="math inline">\(10^{-10}\)</span> m in diameter, a distance also
known as an Angstrom, Å. You have studied atomic physics in detail
previously and should review the basic properties if you do not remember
them. In particular, the concept of electronic energy levels and quantum
numbers will translate directly when we study the shell model of
nuclei.</p>
<p>The nucleus contains <strong>protons</strong> and
<strong>neutrons</strong>, which are collectively known as
<strong>nucleons</strong>. A nucleus is typically <span
class="math inline">\(10^{-14}\)</span> m in diameter, four orders of
magnitude smaller than the atom. We will therefore often work in lengths
scales of <strong>femtometres</strong> (fm), <span
class="math inline">\(10^{-15}\)</span> m. Femtometres are also
sometimes referred to as Fermis (after Enrico Fermi) which conveniently
has the same abbreviation of fm. Nuclear diameters are usually in the
range of 1 to 7 fm (we will come back to what exactly we <em>mean</em>
by the diameter of a nucleus later). Since nucleons are not fundamental
particles they have a finite diameter of around 1.7 fm. (The exact value
is still under investigation<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>).</p>
<h2 id="nuclear-charge">Nuclear charge</h2>
<p>Nucleons are each made of three quarks. Protons have a charge of +1e,
where <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> is the fundamental charge,
<span class="math inline">\(1.6\times10^{-19}\)</span> C. Neutrons are
uncharged. The nucleus has a positive charge of <span
class="math inline">\(Ze\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> is the number of protons. An atom with
a full set of <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> electrons of charge
<span class="math inline">\(-e\)</span> is therefore exactly
neutral.</p>
<h2 id="energy-units">Energy units</h2>
<p>For energy we will work in units of <strong>electronvolts</strong>
(eV). An electronvolt is the energy gained by an electron as it is
accelerated through a potential difference of 1 V. 1 eV = <span
class="math inline">\(1.6 \times 10^{-19}\)</span> J. Energies dealt
with in the nucleus are on the order of MeV (i.e. <span
class="math inline">\(10^6\)</span> eV) (often 10s of MeV). Compare this
to atomic physics, where we are dealing with energies of merely 10s of
eV. This is why nuclear reactions, which involve the nucleus, are a lot
more powerful than chemical reactions, which involve electrons in
atoms.</p>
<h1 id="nuclides">Nuclides</h1>
<p>A nuclide is a specific combination of numbers of protons and
neutrons. For any nuclide we write <span class="math inline">\(\rm
^A_ZX_N\)</span> where</p>
<ul>
<li><p>X is the <strong>chemical symbol</strong> for the corresponding
element</p></li>
<li><p>Z is the <strong>atomic number</strong></p></li>
<li><p>N is the <strong>number of neutrons</strong></p></li>
<li><p>A = Z + N is the <strong>atomic mass number</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, since the chemical symbol allows <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> to be looked up, and <span
class="math inline">\(N = A -Z\)</span>, both <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> are redundant information. So we will
often instead see simpler notations such as <span
class="math inline">\(^{56}\)</span>Fe or Iron-56. Iron has an atomic
number, <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, of 26, and so this
nucleus has <span class="math inline">\(N = 56 - 26 =
30\)</span> neutrons.</p>
<p>It can still be sometimes useful to explicitly provide <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> depending on the context, an example
being when writing nuclear reactions where it makes it easier to check
that everything is conserved.</p>
<p>We then have certain names for variations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Isotopes:</strong> Nuclides with identical Z and
different N</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Isobars:</strong> Nuclides with identical A.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Isotones:</strong> Nuclides with identical N</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Isomers:</strong> Long-lived excited states of
nuclei.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While there are only 118 different elements (different values of Z)
there are over 3000 nuclides (with different values of N and/or Z) that
have been experimentally observed, with around 330 occurring naturally.
Of these around 250 are stable, in the sense that they do not decay over
timescales comparable to the age of the universe. The nuclides found
naturally correspond to only around 90 elements. That is to say that the
list of stable nuclides includes isotopes of many elements (same number
of protons but different number of neutrons). Stable nuclei typically
have <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> slightly larger than <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, i.e. slightly more neutrons that
protons, as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:nuclei"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:nuclei">1</a>.</p>

<img src="figs/nuclei.png" style="width:2.5in" />
<figcaption>Plot of nuclides, showing N against Z. The diagonal black
line is a plot of <span class="math inline">\(Z=N\)</span>, showing that
the stable nuclei (in black) generally have <span
class="math inline">\(N &gt; Z\)</span> for all but very small <span
class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>. The decay modes of the non-stable
nuclei are also shown, these are discussed later in the course. License:

</figure>
<p>Most nuclides are <strong>spherical in shape</strong>, but some are
deformed. We will discuss the reasons for this later on.</p>
<h1 id="masses-of-nuclei">Masses of nuclei</h1>
<p>Nuclear masses are normally given in terms of the <strong>atomic mass
unit</strong>, <span class="math inline">\(u = 1.661 \times
10^{-27}\)</span> kg, which is 1/12th the mass of a neutral carbon atom.
The mass of a proton is <span class="math inline">\(m_p =
1.00727u\)</span>, and a neutron is <span class="math inline">\(m_n =
1.0087u\)</span>. We also sometimes give masses in units of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{MeV/c^2}\)</span>, using the mass energy
relationship <span class="math inline">\(E = mc^2\)</span> (Consult your
Stage 1 special relativity notes for more on this). We have then that
<span class="math inline">\(1u = 931.5~\mathrm{MeV/c^2}\)</span>, so
that nuclei have masses of a few <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{GeV/c^2}\)</span>. Sometimes the <span
class="math inline">\(\rm c^2\)</span> is omitted for convenience and we
refer to masses in units of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{MeV}\)</span>, you will see both forms
during this module.</p>
<p>The masses of nuclei are slightly less than the sum of the masses of
their constituent nucleons, typically by about 0.08<span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> per nucleon (i.e. a nucleus with 100
nucleons would be about <span class="math inline">\(8u\)</span> short.)
This is known as the <strong>mass deficit</strong> or <strong>mass
defect</strong>. The existence of the mass deficit is obvious for
Carbon-12 which has a mass of exactly <span
class="math inline">\(12u\)</span>; since protons and neutrons both
haves masses of greater than <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>,
their total mass must be greater than <span
class="math inline">\(12u\)</span> even before we count the electrons.
The mass deficit is associated with the binding energy of the nucleus
which is discussed in the next section.</p>
<p>The mass of a nucleus can be measured with a <strong>mass
spectrometer</strong>, where essentially a magnetic field bends a stream
of ionised nuclei into an arc with a radius of curvature depending on
the mass of the nuclei. Refer back to the PHYS3220 notes (provided on
the PHYS6660 Moodle page) for details on the mass spectrometer, or see
<em>Krane Section 3.2</em>. A mass spectrometer can also be used to find
the <strong>relative abundance</strong> of different isotopes within a
sample, since nuclides of each isotope will have a different mass and
hence strike the detector of the mass spectrometer at a different
point.</p>
<h1 id="discovery-of-the-nucleus-revision">Discovery of the nucleus
(Revision)</h1>
<p>It was understood since the discovery of the electron in 1897 that
atoms consist of positive and negatively charged elements. After he
discovered the electron, J.J. Thompson proposed in 1904 the <strong>Plum
Pudding Model</strong>, in which the negatively charged electrons are
imagined to be distributed in some continuous positively charged medium.
(If you’re wondering why this is a ‘plum pudding’, in those days people
called raisins plums, so it is really a raisin pudding!) This model was
not completely accepted and raised some questions over whether charges
could penetrate each other.</p>
<p>In 1909, Hands Geiger and Ernest Marsden, under the supervision of
Ernest Rutherford, were conducting experiments in Manchester. They were
firing alpha particles at pieces of thin gold foil. You will study alpha
emission later, but for now you should know that alpha particles are
Helium nuclei, 2 protons and 2 neutrons, although at the time all was
known was that they were small, positively charged pieces of matter.
They expected that the alpha particles would be slightly deflected by
the atoms making up the gold foil.</p>
<p>We can estimate the deflection we might expect using classical
physics. If we have a uniform sphere of positive charge, with negatively
charged electrons dotted within it, then near the surface of the sphere,
unless we happen to be very close to an electron, the net charge is
going to be positive. So the positively charged alpha particle will be
deflected by a Coulomb force. Recall that the magnitude of the Coulomb
force, <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, between two charges is
<span class="math display">\[F = \frac{k q_1 q_2}{r^2},\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is Coulomb’s constant,
<span class="math inline">\(q_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(q_2\)</span> are the two charges and <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is their separation. Referring to
Figure 1, the change in the y component of momentum due to an impulse
from the Coulomb force is given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\delta p_y = F \delta t,\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\delta t\)</span> is the
interaction time, and a change in velocity of</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\delta v_y = \frac{F \delta
t}{m_\alpha},\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(m_\alpha\)</span> is the mass of
the alpha particle.</p>
<figure id="fig:rutherford">
<img src="figs/scattering.png" style="width:2.5in" />
<figcaption>Rutherford scattering in the Plum Pudding Model, showing
deflection of an alpha particle due to Coulomb repulsion.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Let’s assume the force is significant while the alpha particle is
close to the atom, as shown in the diagram, i.e. in a region of length
<span class="math inline">\(2r\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the radius of atom. If the alpha
particle is initially travelling at a velocity of <span
class="math inline">\(v_x\)</span>, then the interaction time will be
<span class="math inline">\(2r/v_x\)</span>. So that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\delta v_y = \frac{k q_1q_2}{m_\alpha
r^2} \frac{2r}{v_x} = \frac{2k q_1 q_2}{m_\alpha rv_x^2}\]</span>.</p>
<p>Putting in the numbers give an angle <span
class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> of less than <span
class="math inline">\(0.02^o\)</span>. We have made a lot of assumptions
and approximations here, but we can at least say that we expect a very
small deflection.</p>
<p>What Geiger and Muller actually found was that some alpha particles
were indeed deflected by a small angle while others seemed to pass
through without any deflection at all. But some were scattered at huge
angles, some even heading back the way they had come. These particles
had clearly experienced a huge electrostatic force of repulsion. The
only way that was possible would be if all of the positive charge was
concentrated in a small area. If the alpha particle travelled through an
area that was empty space, it would barely be deflected. But if it
happened to go near or hit this dense region of positive charge, it
would experience a large force of repulsion and be scattered at a large
angle. This was the discovery of the nucleus, and the idea that the
electrons orbited this positively charged centre.</p>
<p>Rutherford, Geiger and Muller refined this model over a series of
further experiments, allowing them to estimate the size and charge of
the nucleus. The model did have a huge problem (essentially that in
classical physics, the electrons, as accelerating charges, would quickly
radiate all their energy and spiral into the nucleus), which would later
be solved by the quantum mechanical model of the atom.</p>
<h1 id="nuclear-radius">Nuclear radius</h1>
<p>Measuring the nuclear radius is not simple, particularly as there is
no unambiguous boundary between being inside and outside the
nucleus.</p>
<p>Let’s suppose we fire an alpha particle straight at a nucleus. It
starts with some kinetic energy, <span
class="math inline">\(E_K\)</span>. It will be slowed by Coulomb
repulsion as it approaches the nucleus, eventually slowing to a complete
stop before it begins to accelerate back away. The electrostatic
potential energy a distance <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> from
the nucleus will be <span class="math display">\[U = \frac{1}{4 \pi
\epsilon_0} \frac{(2e)(Ze)}{d},\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> is the atomic number of
the nucleus and <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> is the
fundamental charge. At the turn-around point all of the kinetic energy
has been transformed into electrostatic energy, so we have <span
class="math inline">\(U = E_K\)</span>. From the known <span
class="math inline">\(E_K\)</span> we can therefore calculate the
distance of closest approach, <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>. In
Rutherford’s experiment the alpha particles had kinetic energy of around
<span class="math inline">\(E_K = 7.7\)</span> MeV, giving <span
class="math inline">\(r = 30\)</span> fm.</p>
<p>However, this is only an upper limit on the radius. If we started
with a more energetic alpha particle we would get a different value.</p>
<p>An alternative method is electron scattering. Recall the phenomenon
of diffraction, whereby a wave is diffracted depending on the size of an
aperture. If we fire high energy electrons at a nucleus, then the de
Broglie wavelength of the electrons can be made comparable to the size
of the nucleus. So when we detect the scattered electrons we observe
diffraction rings. The radius of the first minimum is then related to
the size of the nucleus.</p>
<p>For example, let’s suppose we fire some electrons with a de Broglie
wavelength of <span class="math inline">\(3 \times 10^{-15}\)</span> m
at a nucleus. (The de Broglie wavelength is <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda = h/p\)</span>, and for very fast
electrons where the kinetic energy dominates over the rest energy, <span
class="math inline">\(p \approx E_K/c\)</span>). Let’s imagine we see a
first order minimum at an angle of <span
class="math inline">\(44^o\)</span>.</p>
<p>The angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> of the first
minimum of the diffraction pattern from a circular apertures of diameter
<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is given by: <span
class="math display">\[\sin \theta = 1.22\frac{\lambda}{d}\]</span></p>
<p>Putting in the numbers for <span class="math inline">\(\theta =
44^o\)</span> gives <span class="math inline">\(d= 4.3\)</span> fm.
Despite the approximations involved (e.g. treating a spherical object of
unknown charge distribution as a uniform disc of charge) this turns out
to be in agreement with other ways of estimating the size of a
nucleus.</p>
<p>In general, the radii of nuclei are found to approximately follow the
rule that: <span class="math display">\[r = r_0A^{1/3}\]</span> where
<span class="math inline">\(r_0 = 1.25\)</span> fm. (Slight variations
on this value will be found in different texts). <span
class="math inline">\(r_0\)</span> does not have any particularly
physical meaning; it is a fitted parameter. Note that since the volume
of the nucleus is simply <span class="math inline">\(V \propto
r^3\)</span>, this means that the volume is roughly proportional to the
number of nucleons, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, suggesting
that the packing of the nucleons (and hence the nuclear density)
<strong>doesn’t change much with <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span></strong>.</p>
<h1 id="nuclear-charge-and-mass-distribution-and-skin-thickness">Nuclear
charge and mass distribution, and skin thickness</h1>
<p>We can now ask how exactly the charge of the nucleus is distributed
within its volume. Experimentally this can be determined using more
elaborate analysis of the scattering type experiments we have already
discussed (see <em>Krane Section 3.1</em> for details). It is found that
the charge density is roughly constant up to a certain point, after
which it decays down to zero, as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:mskin"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:mskin">3</a>. The distance
over which the density drops from 90% to 10% of the value at the centre
of the nucleus is called the <strong>skin thickness</strong>, or <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Interestingly, this turns out to be
largely independent of the atomic mass, with <span
class="math inline">\(t \approx 2.3\)</span> fm.</p>
<figure id="fig:mskin">
<img src="figs/thickness.png" style="width:2.5in" />
<figcaption>Skin thickness is the radial range over which the nuclear
charge density drops between 0.9 and 0.1 of the maximum. </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Note that, since electron scattering experiment involve only the
Coulomb force, these are only telling us about the distribution of the
charged nucleons, the protons. It could be, for example, that the
neutrons are arranged entirely differently (for example surrounding the
protons), giving a much large radius of nuclear matter (as opposed to
radius of nuclear charge).</p>
<p>If we were to fire helium nuclei (alpha particles) at a heavier
nucleus, as in Rutherford’s experiments, at sufficiently high energies
we would begin to see effects due to the nuclear force which is felt by
neutrons as well as protons (more on this in the next section). Detailed
experiments (beyond the scope of this course) show that the radius of
nuclear matter is very similar to the radius of nuclear charge,
suggesting that the protons and neutrons are intermingled. We will
therefore not really need to distinguish between these two definitions
of the nuclear radius.</p>
<h1 id="review-of-radioactive-decay-and-half-life-revision">Review of
Radioactive Decay and Half Life (Revision)</h1>
<p>Most nuclides are unstable and decay over time periods ranging from
fractions of a second to millions of years. The three most common types
of decay (alpha, beta and gamma) are studied is more detail in Section
5, but briefly:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Alpha Decay is the emission of a helium nucleus (2p2n) and occurs
mostly in heavier nuclei</p></li>
<li><p>Beta Decay is the emission of an electron or positron</p></li>
<li><p>Gamma Decay is the emission of a photon, and usually occurs
alongside other kinds of decay</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of the type of decay, the occurrence is stochastic - we
cannot determine exactly when a decay will occur, only define the
probability of it occurring within a certain time period. As each
individual nucleus has its own independent probability of decaying, the
decay rate of a sample depends on the number of non-decayed nuclei,
<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> present, and so:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[- \frac{dN}{dt} = \lambda N\]</span></p>
<p>where we have defined the constant of proportionality, <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, known as the decay constant. The
negative shows us that the number of non-decayed nuclei decreases with
time.</p>
<p>The solution to this equation, obtained simply by separation of
variables, is: <span class="math display">\[N(t) = N_0 \exp{(-\lambda
t)}\]</span></p>
<p>which shows us that the number of un-decayed nuclei drops
exponentially.</p>
<p>We further define:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The activity, A as the number of decays in a sample per unit
time. We define 1  (Becquerel) as 1 decay per second.</p></li>
<li><p>The half life, <span class="math inline">\(t_{1/1}\)</span>, as
the time for half of the sample to decay</p></li>
<li><p>The specific activity, as the number of decays per unit time per
amount of sample (e.g. measured by mass or number of nuclei).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When radiation interacts with matter, it deposits energy. We measure
this dose in units of Grays, Gy, equivalent to 1 J/kg. When dealing with
health effects of radiation, we instead use units of Sievert, Sv, which
weights the dose to take account of the biological effects of the
particular type of radiation. This is not discussed further here but if
you are taking the medical physics module you will study this in
detail.</p>
