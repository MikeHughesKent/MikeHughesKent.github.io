<h1 class="title">Nuclear Physics Section 3 - The Deuteron</h1>
<p class="author">Mike Hughes</p>
<p class="date">Physics and Astronomy, University of Kent</p>
</header>
<p>In this section we will develop a simple quantum model of the
simplest nucleus of interest - the deuteron. We begin with revision of
some key ideas in quantum mechanics.</p>
<h1 id="introducing-the-deuteron">Introducing the Deuteron</h1>
<p>When you studied quantum and atomic physics, the simplest model for
understanding atomic structure was the Hydrogen atom, consisting of a
proton and an electron. While Hydrogen notionally has a nucleus,
consisting of one proton, there is no nuclear force or potential
involved, as we have only a single nucleon. So we will instead study a
nucleus consisting of one proton and one neutron - called a deuteron
(<span class="math inline">\(A = 2, Z=1, N = 1\)</span>). (If we were to
add an electron we would obtain an atom going by the perhaps more
familiar name of deuterium).</p>
<p>We could also try to make nuclei with two nucleons (A=2) by putting
together two protons or two neutrons. However, neither of these
possibilities form stable nuclei; we will see why shortly.</p>
<p>While the (charge) radius of the deuteron nucleus is 2.2 fm, the
average separation of the proton and neutron in a deuteron turns out to
be 4.2 fm, larger than the expected range of the nuclear force. We
therefore could predict that this is going to be a very loosely bound
nucleus, and indeed we find a binding energy per nucleon of 1.1 MeV,
much less than the typical 8 MeV for larger nuclei.</p>
<h1 id="quantum-mechanics-review">Quantum Mechanics Review</h1>
<p>We will briefly review some quantum mechanics as a reminder of
important concepts we will need later. This is not a detailed
discussion; consult your notes from last year or textbooks for the
details.</p>
<h2 id="d-infinite-square-well">1D Infinite Square Well</h2>
<p>Consider a particle which sits in a 1D potential well (or ‘box’).
Between position <span class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x=L\)</span> the potential, <span
class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, is 0. Outside of this region, the
potential is infinite. This is known as the infinite square well. <span
class="math display">\[V(x) =
    \begin{cases}
      0,  &amp; \text{if}~ 0 &lt; x &lt; L \\
      \infty,&amp;  \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}\]</span> and this is shown in Figure <a
href="#fig:infinite_well_energy" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:infinite_well_energy">1</a>.</p>
<figure id="fig:infinite_well_energy">
<img src="figs/infinite_well_energy.png" />
<figcaption>Infinite square well. The shaded regions represent the
barrier potential, the unshaded region is the inside of the potential
well.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can find the wavefunction for the particle, <span
class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span>, using the time-independent,
non-relativistic Schrödinger equation, <span
class="math display">\[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} +
V(x)\psi(x) = E\psi.\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\hbar\)</span> is a constant, <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the mass of the particle, <span
class="math inline">\(V(x)\)</span> is the potential energy and <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is the particle’s energy. If we solve
this equation for the infinite potential well, we find that the
wavefunction must be zero in the region of infinite potential, whereas
inside the well it takes the general form <span
class="math display">\[\psi = A \sin kx + B \cos kx,\]</span> where
<span class="math display">\[k = \frac{\sqrt{2mE}}{\hbar}.\]</span></p>
<p>However, the wavefunction must be continuous everywhere. Generally
the derivative must also be continuous, but we will have to allow
ourselves to sidestep this rule for infinite discontinuities in the
potential (these aren’t terrible physical in any case, so we can think
of this more of an abstraction rather than a real physical system). The
first condition essentially means that the wavefunction must be zero at
the box boundaries (<span class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x=L\)</span>), which means that only certain
values of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> are allowed, and also
that <span class="math inline">\(B = 0\)</span> (since <span
class="math inline">\(\cos 0 \ne 0)\)</span> If we substitute the
wavefunction in and impose these conditions, we find the allowed energy
values are: <span class="math display">\[E_n = \frac{\hbar^2
\pi^2}{2mL^2}n^2 \quad  \mathrm{where} \quad n \in
\mathbb{N}\]</span></p>
<p>(Note <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> is the set of
natural numbers, or positive integers, 1,2,3 etc, so <span
class="math inline">\(n \in \mathbb{N}\)</span> means <span
class="math inline">\(n=1,2,3...\)</span>). The important thing here is
that there are only discrete allowed energy levels for the particle, and
that these are not evenly spaced.</p>
<p>The corresponding wavefunction is <span
class="math display">\[\psi_n(x) =
\sqrt{\frac{2}{L}}\sin(k_nx),\]</span> where the normalisation factor is
found by ensuring that <span class="math display">\[\int \psi(x)^2 dx =
1.\]</span> Given that the square of the wavefunction is the probability
of finding the particle in the interval <span class="math inline">\(x +
dx\)</span>, this is equivalent to saying that the probability of
finding the particle somewhere in the box is 1. The first four
wavefunctions are shown in Figure <a href="#fig:infinite_well_wf"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:infinite_well_wf">2</a>.</p>
<figure id="fig:infinite_well_wf">
<img src="figs/infinite_well_wf.png" />
<figcaption>Wavefunctions for infinite square well for <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> = 1 to 4. The wavefunctions are
overlaid onto the potential plot at different heights, but of course the
units of the wavefunction are not energy, this is purely for
illustrative purposes.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="d-finite-square-well">1D Finite Square Well</h2>
<p>If we adjust our potential well so that the potential barrier
enclosing the box is not infinite, giving a potential energy with some
finite value <span class="math inline">\(V_0\)</span>, so that we have:
<span class="math display">\[V(x) =
    \begin{cases}
      0, &amp; \text{if}\ -L/2 &lt; x &lt; L/2 \\
      V_0, &amp; \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}\]</span> and if we assume that the particle has an
energy <span class="math inline">\(E &lt; V_0\)</span>, so that it is
trapped in the box (classically), then the solution to the Schrödinger
equation is different. We now have a non-zero wavefunction in the region
with <span class="math inline">\(V(x) = V_0\)</span>, although this
decays rapidly with distance from the edge of the barrier. After
applying the wavefunction normalisability condition (i.e. ensuring that
<span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> does not go to infinity), we
find solutions: <span class="math display">\[\psi_2 = A\sin(kx) + B
\cos(kx)\]</span> inside the box (<span class="math inline">\(-L/2 &lt;
x &lt; L/2\)</span>), and solutions <span class="math display">\[\psi_1
= C\exp(-\alpha x)\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[\psi_3 =
C\exp(\alpha x)\]</span> in the left (<span class="math inline">\(x &lt;
-L/2\)</span>) and right (<span class="math inline">\(x &gt;
L/2\)</span>) barrier regions, respectively.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is no analytical solution this time, but some
algebraic manipulation gets things into a form where solutions can be
found numerically. It turns out that there are finite number of bound
states (unlike the infinite square well which has an infinite number of
solutions). Of course if <span class="math inline">\(E &gt; V_0\)</span>
then the particle is no longer bound. The finite potential well and some
example energy levels for a particular configuration are shown in Figure
<a href="#fig:finite_well_energy" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:finite_well_energy">3</a>.</p>
<figure id="fig:finite_well_energy">
<img src="figs/finite_well_energy.png" />
<figcaption>Energy diagram for finite square well in 1D. Example energy
levels are shown as dashed blue lines.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can perform the same operation for other potentials. For example,
the harmonic oscillator has a potential energy of the form <span
class="math inline">\(V \propto x^2\)</span> and has solutions with
energy levels <span class="math inline">\(E_n = E(n + 1/2)\hbar
\omega\)</span> where where <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>
is the angular frequency of oscillation (as defined classically). Here,
again, there are infinitely many solutions, and in this case they happen
to be equally spaced. Like the finite square well, positions outside of
the well will have non-zero but decaying solutions.</p>
<h2 id="potentials-in-3d">Potentials in 3D</h2>
<p>To model the physical world we need to consider potentials in 3D. You
have already seen this for the <span class="math inline">\(1/r\)</span>
Coulomb potential when you modelled the atom in PHYS5030.</p>
<p>Perhaps the simplest 3D potential is a cubical box of dimensions
<span class="math inline">\(a \times a \times a\)</span>. The potential
energy is: <span class="math display">\[V(x,y,z) =
    \begin{cases}
        0 &amp; 0 \leq x \leq a, \quad 0 \leq y \leq a, \quad 0 \leq z
\leq a \\
        \infty &amp; x &lt; 0, \quad x &gt;a, \quad y &lt;0, \quad y&gt;
a, \quad z &lt; 0, \quad z &gt;a
    \end{cases}\]</span> Outside of the box the potential is infinite
and so <span class="math inline">\(\psi = 0\)</span> here.</p>
<p>The 3D time-independent Schrödinger equation is <span
class="math display">\[-\frac{\hbar}{2m} \nabla^2 \psi + V\psi =
E\psi,\]</span></p>
<p>or more explicitly in Cartesian co-ordinates <span
class="math display">\[-\frac{\hbar}{2m} \bigg (\frac{\partial ^2
\psi}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial ^2 \psi}{\partial y^2} +
\frac{\partial ^2 \psi}{\partial z^2} \bigg) + V(x,y,z)\psi(x,y,z)= E
\psi(x,y,z).\]</span> Solving this for the 3D square box, we obtain
eigenfunctions (wavefunctions) of the form <span
class="math display">\[\psi_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = \sqrt{\bigg (\frac{2}{a}
\bigg)^2} \sin \frac{n_x \pi x}{a} \sin \frac{n_y \pi y}{a} \sin
\frac{n_z \pi z}{a},\]</span> with energy eigenvalues <span
class="math display">\[E_{n_x,n_y,n_z} = \frac{\hbar^2\pi^2}{2ma^2}
(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2).\]</span> The solutions are now parameterised by
three integers, <span class="math inline">\(n_x\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(n_y\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(n_z\)</span>. The lowest possible energy state
(the ground state) is (1,1,1). Notice that we have multiple states (i.e
different wavefunctions with different corresponding probability density
distributions) that have the same energy. For example, (1,1,2) and
(1,2,1). These states are called <strong>degenerate</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s unlikely we will encounter cube-shaped potentials in nuclear
physics. Instead we expect our potentials to be spherical, and it might
be a reasonable first guess to assume that our potentials will be
spherically symmetric, i.e. that the potential will only vary as
function of distance <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> from the
centre of the potential (a ‘central potential’). It is now natural to
work in spherical polar co-ordinates (<span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>) rather than Cartesian co-ordinates,
for reasons that are hopefully obvious.</p>
<p>The Schrödinger equation in spherical co-ordinates looks unpleasant,
<span class="math display">\[-\frac{\hbar}{2m}   \bigg[
\frac{1}{r^2}  \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \bigg(r^2 \frac{\partial
\psi}{\partial r} \bigg) + \frac{1}{r^2\sin\theta}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\bigg( \sin \theta \frac{\partial
\psi}{\partial \theta} \bigg) + \frac{1}{r^2 \sin^2\theta}
\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial \theta^2}\bigg] + V(r,\theta
\phi)\psi(r, \theta, \psi) = E\psi(r, \theta, \psi)\]</span></p>
<p>but can now simplify things greatly by assuming a separable solution
of the form: <span class="math display">\[\psi(r, \theta, \phi) = R(r)
\Theta(\theta) \Phi(\phi)\]</span></p>
<p>The important thing to realise is that as the potential is only a
function of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, and not <span
class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>, it is only the <span
class="math inline">\(R(r)\)</span> part of the solution that depends on
the potential. The angular part, <span
class="math inline">\(\Theta(\theta) \Phi(\phi)\)</span>, can be solved
independently of the potential.</p>
<p>The solutions to the angular part are called <strong>spherical
harmonics</strong>, which you have already studied in PHYS5030 (and saw
some associated mathematics in PHYS5880). These solutions are
parameterised by <strong>two quantum numbers: <span
class="math inline">\(l\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(m_l\)</span></strong>, the angular momentum
quantum number and the magnetic quantum number. For a given <span
class="math inline">\(l\)</span> there are <span
class="math inline">\(2l + 1\)</span> possible values of <span
class="math inline">\(m_l\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(m_l
= 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, ... \pm l\)</span>. Solutions with different <span
class="math inline">\(m_l\)</span> but the same <span
class="math inline">\(l\)</span> have the same energy, such that states
are <span class="math inline">\((2l + 1)\)</span>-fold degenerate.</p>
<p>The radial part (known as the radial equation) can be re-written as
<span class="math display">\[-\frac{\hbar}{2m} \frac{1}{r^2}
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}r} \bigg( r^2
\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}r}\bigg) + \bigg[ V(r)+ \frac{
\hbar^2l(l+1)}{2mr^2} \bigg ] R = ER.\]</span> Check back in your
PHYS5030 to see how this is obtained, but you should recognise that this
now looks very similar to the 1D wave equation but with a modified
‘effective’ potential, <span class="math display">\[V_{eff} = V(r)+
\frac{ \hbar^2l(l+1)}{2mr^2}\]</span> We also have to be a bit careful
because we now have that <span class="math inline">\(r&gt;0\)</span>
which matters when we choose the boundary condition at <span
class="math inline">\(r=0\)</span>. The <span
class="math inline">\(l\)</span> is the angular momentum quantum number,
discussed more below.</p>
<p>The solution for radial part of the wavefunction, <span
class="math inline">\(R(r)\)</span>, depends on the specific potential
we are dealing with. Solutions to the radial part are parameterised by
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(l\)</span>, but the exact form and the allowed
values of <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> depend on the
potential. For example, in atomic physics when you looked at the
Hydrogen atom using the Coulomb (<span
class="math inline">\(1/r)\)</span> potential, you found that <span
class="math inline">\(l = 0,1,2,3 ... (n-1)\)</span> and that the energy
does not depend on <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>. In this case
each energy level works out to be <span
class="math inline">\(n^2\)</span>-fold degenerate.</p>
<h2 id="angular-momentum-and-spin">Angular Momentum and Spin</h2>
<p>Finally, a quick reminder on the quantum theory of angular momentum
(again, consult your PHYS5030 notes for the details). Angular momentum
is a vector, <span class="math inline">\(\vec{L}\)</span>, but unlike in
classical physics, it is not possible to know the three components of
the angular momentum vector simultaneously (i.e. the operators for the
x, y and z components do not commute). By convention we choose to
specify two quantities: the magnitude of the angular momentum, <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> (or sometimes the magnitude squared
<span class="math inline">\(L^2\)</span>), which does commute with the
three components, and the z-component, <span
class="math inline">\(L_z\)</span>. The <span
class="math inline">\(L_x\)</span> and the <span
class="math inline">\(L_y\)</span> components are then unknown.</p>
<p>In the case of spherical harmonics, the magnitude of the angular
momentum and the z-component of angular momentum are related to the
quantum numbers <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(m_l\)</span>. <span class="math display">\[L =
\hbar \sqrt{l(l+1)}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[L_z = \hbar
m_l\]</span></p>
<p>There is another type of angular momentum which is intrinsic to
particles, called <strong>spin</strong>. Unlike the angular momentum we
have defined above, which for atoms and nucleons is generally referred
to as ‘orbital angular momentum’ by analogy with a planetary-type model
where electrons are orbiting the nucleus, the spin has less obvious
classical analogies. Again, spin is a vector <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{S}\)</span>, and we parameterise the spin in
terms of quantum numbers <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(m_s\)</span>, with the spin magnitude: <span
class="math display">\[S = \hbar \sqrt{s(s+1)}\]</span> and the <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-component: <span
class="math display">\[S_z = \hbar m_s\]</span></p>
<p>Unlike the orbital angular momentum, for which the <span
class="math inline">\(l\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(m_l\)</span> take integer values, fermions have a
spin quantum number of <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span>, with
<span class="math inline">\(m_s = \pm 1/2\)</span>.</p>
<p>The total angular momentum is the vector sum of the orbital and spin
angular momenta: <span class="math display">\[\vec{J}= \vec{L} +
\vec{S}\]</span></p>
<p>Again we have quantum numbers <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(m_j\)</span> which parameterise the
magnitude <span class="math display">\[J = \hbar \sqrt{j(j+1)}\]</span>
and the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-component <span
class="math display">\[J_z = \hbar m_j\]</span> where this time we have
<span class="math inline">\(m_j = -j, -j +1, ... j-1, j\)</span>.</p>
<p>We call this effect the coupling of the orbital and spin angular
momenta. A little bit of thought should allow you to check that: <span
class="math display">\[m_j = m_l + m_s = m_l \pm 1/2\]</span> Given that
<span class="math inline">\(m_l\)</span> is an integer, we will always
have that <span class="math inline">\(m_j\)</span> is a half integer
(-1/2, +1/2 etc), and hence <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> will
also be a half integer. In fact we can see that <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span> can either be <span
class="math inline">\(l + 1/2\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(l-1/2\)</span></p>
<h1 id="a-simple-model-of-the-deuteron">A Simple Model of the
Deuteron</h1>
<p>Modelling the deuteron is a two body problem: the interaction between
two nucleons. As for any two-body problem we can treat this as a central
force problem, i.e. we are considering one of the nucleons to be at the
centre of the potential. We then work with the reduced mass. Here we
have a proton and a neutron and the reduced mass is <span
class="math display">\[M = \frac{m_pm_n}{m_p + m_n}.\]</span> However,
since <span class="math inline">\(m_p \approx m_n\)</span>, and we are
making a first order approximation here, we can use some nominal
approximate mass <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> for both
nucleons, such that <span class="math inline">\(M \approx
m/2\)</span>.</p>

<figcaption>Energy diagram for deuteron. The potential <span
class="math inline">\(V_0\)</span> is unknown, but we can experimentally
measure the binding energy <span class="math inline">\(E_B\)</span> and
nuclear radius (<span class="math inline">\(r_0\)</span>).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Unfortunately, we don’t know what the potential due to the nuclear
force looks like. So let’s guess that it is a finite radial square well,
as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:deuteron_energy"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:deuteron_energy">4</a>.
This looks similar to the 1D potential well we reviewed above, but bear
in mind this is a 3D system for which we are plotting against the radius
and that <span class="math inline">\(r &gt; 0\)</span>, which has some
consequences for what must happen to the wavefunction at <span
class="math inline">\(r=0\)</span>.</p>
<p>We now need to solve the Schrödinger equation in 3D: <span
class="math display">\[\bigg[ -\frac{\hbar}{2M} \nabla^2 + V(r) \bigg]
\psi(r,\theta, \phi) = E \psi(r, \theta, \phi)\]</span> where we have
used <span class="math inline">\(\nabla^2\)</span> to represent the
Laplacian.</p>
<p>As discussed above, for a spherically symmetrical potential the
solution is separable: <span class="math display">\[\psi_{n,l,m} (r,
\theta, \psi)  = R_{nl}Y_{lm}(\theta, \phi)\]</span> where we have
indicated that we expect the solutions to be paramaterised by the three
quantum numbers <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(l\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(m_l\)</span>.</p>
<p>The radial component of the wavefunction, <span
class="math inline">\(R(r)\)</span> satisfies the radial equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\bigg( - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \bigg(
\frac{d}{dr^2} +  \frac{2}{r}\frac{d}{dr} \bigg) + V(r) + \frac{\hbar^2
l (l+1)}{2mr^2} \bigg) R(r) = -E_bR(r)\]</span></p>
<p>(Check back in your PHYS5030 notes to see how this is
determined).</p>
<p>Let’s begin by making the assumption that we are in the <span
class="math inline">\(l=0\)</span> solution which is spherically
symmetric (i.e. the wavefunction has no dependence on <span
class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>). So we only need to find the <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> part of the wavefunction. And setting
<span class="math inline">\(l=0\)</span> means that the radial part is
also simplified to:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\bigg( - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \bigg(
\frac{d}{dr^2} +  \frac{2}{r}\frac{d}{dr} \bigg) + V(r) \bigg) R(r) =
-E_bR(r)
\label{eqn:R_comp}\]</span></p>
<p>We don’t know the width of the square well, but let’s guess that it
is the nuclear radius, <span class="math inline">\(r_0 =
2.1\)</span> fm. So that we have: <span class="math display">\[V(x) =
    \begin{cases}
      0, &amp; \text{if}\ 0 &lt; r &lt; r_0 \\
      V_0, &amp; \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}\]</span></p>
<p>The depth of the nuclear potential energy well <span
class="math inline">\(V_0\)</span> is unknown. We do, however, know the
binding energy, <span class="math inline">\(E_B = 2.225\)</span> MeV,
for a deuteron (measured via the mass defect or by the gamma ray energy
released when a proton and neutron fuse). The depth of the well must be
larger than this, otherwise the deuteron wouldn’t be bound.</p>
<p>To simplify things, we will rewrite this in terms of <span
class="math inline">\(rR\)</span> rather than <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>. This will allow us to simplify things
because</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{d^2}{dr^2}(rR) = \frac{d}{dr}
\bigg( r\frac{dR}{dr} + R \bigg) = \frac{dR}{dr} + r\frac{d^2R}{dr^2} +
\frac{dR}{dr} = r\frac{d^2R}{dr^2} + 2 \frac{dR}{dr}.\]</span></p>
<p>Using this result we can write Equation <a href="#eqn:R_comp"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eqn:R_comp">[eqn:R_comp]</a>
in a simpler form, and are now looking for a solution (wavefunction)
that satisfies the differential equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{d^2}{dr^2} rR -
\frac{M}{\hbar^2}[V(r) + E_b](rR) = 0\]</span></p>
<p>Note that we have also used that the reduced mass <span
class="math inline">\(M = m/2\)</span>.</p>
<p>The square well model means that the potential energy <span
class="math inline">\(V(r)\)</span> is a discontinuous step function. We
can therefore find piecewise solutions, one for the region outside the
well satisfying: <span class="math display">\[\frac{d^2}{dr^2}(rR) -
\frac{M}{\hbar^2}(V_0 - E_b)(rR) = 0\]</span> and one for the region
inside the well, satisfying:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{d^2}{dr^2}(rR) -
\frac{M}{\hbar^2}E_b(rR) = 0\]</span> where we have used that <span
class="math inline">\(V_0 = 0\)</span> inside the well.</p>
<p>Taking inspiration from the 1D finite well, if we define wavenumbers
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span> in the normal way, such that <span
class="math display">\[k = \frac{\sqrt{2ME_b}}{\hbar} ,\]</span> and</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[K = \frac{\sqrt{2M(V_0 – E)}}{\hbar}
,\]</span> then we can then write the differential equations in a
simpler form: <span class="math display">\[(rR)&#39;&#39; + K^2(rR) =
0\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[(rR)&#39;&#39; – k^2(rR) =
0\]</span></p>
<p>The solutions are <span class="math display">\[rR(r) = \begin{cases}
       a \sin Kr &amp;  r &lt; r_0 \\
       b \exp(-kr) &amp;  r &gt; r_0
    \end{cases}\]</span></p>
<p>Note that mathematical solution <span class="math inline">\(\cos
(Kr)\)</span> inside the well would cause problems at <span
class="math inline">\(r = 0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\exp(kr)\)</span> outside the well would not be
normalisable, so we have rejected these solutions as unphysical.</p>
<p>We now apply the boundary condition of the continuity of <span
class="math inline">\(rR\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\((rR)’\)</span> at the discontinuity in <span
class="math inline">\(V_0\)</span>. With a little bit of manipulation,
we obtain: <span class="math display">\[K \cot K r_0 = -k\]</span></p>
<p>Referring back to the definition of <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> we see that they are in terms of
experimentally measurable quantities, <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(E_B\)</span>, and the unknown potential <span
class="math inline">\(V_0\)</span>. We can therefore solve (numerically)
for potential, giving us <span class="math inline">\(V_0 \approx
35\)</span> MeV. This is shown in a Jupyter notebook here: <a
href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/MikeHughesKent/nuclear/master?filepath=deuteron.ipynb">https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/MikeHughesKent/nuclear/master?filepath=deuteron.ipynb</a>.</p>

<figcaption>Deuteron wavefunction, assuming a square well
potential.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>(Compare this to a standard quantum mechanical problem where we would
be given <span class="math inline">\(V_0\)</span> and would solve for
the energy <span class="math inline">\(E_B\)</span>.)</p>
<p>From the plot of the deuteron wavefunction in Figure <a
href="#fig:deuteron_wf" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:deuteron_wf">5</a>, we can see that it extends
significantly outside of the well, meaning that the nucleons have a
large probability of being separated by more than the interaction range
of the nuclear force. (As we said earlier, the mean distance is 4.4 fm,
despite the well radius of around 2 fm.)</p>
<p>In this model there is only a single bound solution – there are no
bound excited states. Even in the ground state the nucleons are very
close to the top of the well. This is also what is found experimentally,
i.e. we do not observe excited states of the deuteron.</p>
<h1 id="determining-the-state-of-the-deuteron">Determining the State of
the Deuteron</h1>
<p>We assumed in the above that the deuteron is in an <span
class="math inline">\(l=0\)</span> state, but is that correct? To
investigate this, we are now going to work out the angular momentum of
the deuteron, which is a combination of the spins and orbital angular
momenta of its constituent proton and neutron. Recall that the total
angular momentum is the vector sum of the spin (intrinsic) angular
momentum, <span class="math inline">\(\vec{S}\)</span> and the orbital
angular momentum (<span class="math inline">\(\vec{L}\)</span>). Protons
and neutrons are fermions, with spin 1/2. The total of their spin is the
vector sum: <span class="math display">\[\vec{S} = \vec{S_n} +
\vec{S_p}\]</span> Depending on whether the spins are parallel or
anti-parallel, (i.e. whether the <span
class="math inline">\(m_s\)</span> have the same or opposite sign) this
means that the total spin magnitude quantum number for the deuteron can
be <span class="math inline">\(s=0\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(s=1\)</span>, depending on whether the two spins
are aligned or anti-aligned.</p>
<p>Recall that there are <span class="math inline">\(2s + 1\)</span>
possible values for the z-component of spin, <span
class="math inline">\(m_s\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the deuteron has <span class="math inline">\(s = 0\)</span>
(anti-parallel spins which sum to 0), there is therefore only one
possibility, <span class="math inline">\(m_s = 0\)</span>. We call this
a <strong>singlet</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(s=1\)</span>, we have three
possible values, <span class="math inline">\(m_s = -1, 0, +1\)</span>.
This is called a <strong>triplet</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now we also need to take in account the orbital angular momentum to
obtain the total angular momentum for the deuteron. (Slightly
confusingly this is usually called the ‘spin’ of the nucleus, but
remember that it includes the orbital angular momentum of the nucleons
as well as their spins). <span class="math display">\[\vec{J} = \vec{L}
+ \vec{S}\]</span></p>
<p>Note that this is a vector equation. First try to imagine this
classically (Figure <a href="#fig:jls_combo" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:jls_combo">6</a>). If <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{L}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{S}\)</span> are aligned, we would end up with
a vector <span class="math inline">\(\vec{J}\)</span> with a magnitude
(length) of <span class="math inline">\(|L + S|\)</span>. If they were
anti-aligned (i.e. pointing in opposite directions) we would have a
vector of length <span class="math inline">\(|L-S|\)</span>. If there
was some other angle between the vectors, we would end up with a some
intermediate length <span class="math inline">\(|L-S| \leq J \leq
|L+S|\)</span>.</p>
<figure id="fig:jls_combo">
<img src="figs/JLS_combo.png" />
<figcaption>Classical combination of orbital and spin angular momenta,
showing the general case (left) and the cases leading to the largest
(middle) and smallest (right) magnitudes of the total angular
momentum.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In quantum mechanics, <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> comes in
discrete units, such that <span class="math inline">\(J = \hbar
\sqrt{j(j + 1)}\)</span> where the quantum number <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is an integer. So the quantum number,
<span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, takes integer values such that
<span class="math inline">\(|l-s| \leq j \leq |l+s|\)</span>.</p>
<p>While we assumed that <span class="math inline">\(l=0\)</span> when
we found the wavefunction we don’t actually know that this is the case,
so let’s consider some possibilities (for <span class="math inline">\(l
&lt; 3\)</span>):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(l = 0, s = 0\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(j = 0\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(l = 0, s = 1\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(j = 1\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(l = 1, s = 0\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(j = 1\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(l = 1, s = 1\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span> could be <span
class="math inline">\(0,1,2\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(l = 2, s = 0\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(j = 2\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(l = 2, s = 1\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span> could be <span
class="math inline">\(1,2,3\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Experimentally, we measure <span class="math inline">\(j=1\)</span>.
This rules out those combinations where <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span> cannot be 1. The possibilities we are
left with are: <span class="math inline">\(^3S_1\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(^1P_1\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(^3P_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(^3D_1\)</span>. (Higher values of <span
class="math inline">\(l&gt;2\)</span> also cannot have <span
class="math inline">\(j=1\)</span>, which you can easily check).</p>
<p><strong>Here we have introduced a new notation, related to the
spectroscopic notation you saw in Atomic Physics</strong>. The letter
(e.g. <span class="math inline">\(S, P\)</span>) tells us the <span
class="math inline">\(l\)</span> quantum number (recall <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(l =
0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(l = 1\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(l =
2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(l=3\)</span>). The superscript is the number of
<span class="math inline">\(m_s\)</span> states (i.e. <span
class="math inline">\(2s + 1\)</span>), which tells us <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, and the subscript is the value of the
quantum number <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. So in general, we
write <span class="math inline">\(^{2s + 1}X_j\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(X = S,P,D,F...\)</span>.</p>
<p>(Note that when we refer to the total angular momentum of the
nucleus, or the ‘spin’ of the nucleus, we often use the symbol <span
class="math inline">\(I\)</span> rather than <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. )</p>
<p>So which of these states is correct? To determine this we need some
more experimental information. Luckily, we have just that.</p>
<h2 id="parity">Parity</h2>
<p>We now need to introduce an important concept called parity,
sometimes indicated by <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>. Parity
is a concept related to the symmetry of the wavefunction about the
origin (the centre of the nucleus in our case). We call the case where
<span class="math display">\[\psi(-r) = \psi(r)\]</span></p>
<p>even parity, while: <span class="math display">\[\psi(-r) =
-\psi(r)\]</span> is called odd parity. Even parity is often represented
with a ‘+’, and odd parity is represented by a ‘-’.</p>
<p>While an arbitrary wavefunction will not have even or odd parity
(formally it would not be an eigenfunction of the Parity operator), an
important mathematical result is that states in a 3D potential (i.e.
spherical harmonics) with an odd <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>
have odd parity and states with an even <span
class="math inline">\(l\)</span> have even parity. Or, more neatly <span
class="math display">\[\text{parity} = (-1)^l\]</span></p>
<p>Experimentally, the deuteron is found to have even parity. This means
that it must be in a state with an even <span
class="math inline">\(l\)</span>. This rules out the <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span> states, it must be in <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span>.</p>
<p>So we are nearly there, we have narrowed it down to two possible
states, we just need a bit more information.</p>
<h2 id="magnetic-moment-of-the-deuteron">Magnetic Moment of the
Deuteron</h2>
<p>Whenever we have charged particles in motion we generate a magnetic
field. We can see this using a classical analogy for atoms (imagine the
charged electron circling the nucleus) but a similar effect occurs in
the nucleus. This strength and orientation of this effect is called the
<strong>nuclear magnetic moment</strong>.</p>
<p>The total magnetic moment is a combination of orbit and spin magnetic
moments.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mu = \mu_l + \mu_s\]</span></p>
<p>For the deuteron ground state we assumed initially that <span
class="math inline">\(l = 0\)</span>, so there is no orbital angular
momentum and hence no orbital magnetic moment. But we still have the
spin - the intrinsic angular momentum - and so do expect a spin magnetic
moment. We write this as: <span class="math display">\[\mu_s  =
\frac{1}{2} g \mu_N\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\mu_N\)</span> is the nuclear
magneton (a constant which is a similar concept to the Bohr magneton
studied in Atomic Physics), and is given by: <span
class="math display">\[\mu_N  = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_p}\]</span> (Recall
from Atomic Physics that the definition of the Bohr magneton was the
same, but with <span class="math inline">\(m_e\)</span> replacing <span
class="math inline">\(m_p\)</span>.</p>
<p>The factor of <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> is the spin
and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is called the
<strong>gyromagnetic ratio</strong>, it depends on the specific particle
we are dealing with. Experimentally we find:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For a neutron, g = -3.8262.</p></li>
<li><p>For a proton, g = 5.586.</p></li>
<li><p>For an electron you may recall it is approximately -2.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, this implies that the nucleus has a magnetic moment,
despite it being uncharged. (The explanation for this is that, while the
neutron has no net charge, it is made of quarks which <em>are</em>
charged; it therefore has some internal distribution of charge).</p>
<p>So we can therefore calculate the magnetic moment of the deuteron, in
terms of the nuclear magneton (which is a constant), by taking the
(known) magnetic moments of the proton and the neutron and summing:
<span class="math display">\[\mu_d = \mu_p + \mu_n = (2.7928 -
1.9130)\mu_N = 0.8798 \mu_N\]</span></p>
<p>However, when the magnetic moment is measured, we find it to be <span
class="math inline">\(0.85741 \mu_N\)</span>. How can this be?</p>
<p>We have accounted for the contribution of spin, but what about
orbital angular momentum? We assumed that <span
class="math inline">\(l=0\)</span> and hence <span
class="math inline">\(L = 0\)</span>, i.e. there was no orbital angular
momentum.</p>
<p>This suggests that perhaps the deuteron is not in the <span
class="math inline">\(^3S_1\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(l =
0\)</span>) state after all. If it were in state with <span
class="math inline">\(l \ne 0\)</span> we would have some orbital
angular momentum, and perhaps this would give us the experimentally
observed magnetic moment.</p>
<p>We could try calculating the expected magnetic moment for <span
class="math inline">\(^3D_1\)</span> (we know we are not in <span
class="math inline">\(l = 1\)</span> because of the measured parity).
Now we have <span class="math inline">\(l = 2\)</span>, so we also have
a contribution from the orbital angular magnetic moment. Unfortunately
when this calculation is done it turns out to give a total magnetic
moment of <span class="math inline">\(0.310 \mu_N\)</span>, which is
even worse.</p>
<p>The solution is that the nucleus exists in a superposition of these
states. (In quantum mechanics we can make a new solution or state by
weighted sums of solutions). That is, the total wavefunction would be:
<span class="math display">\[\psi = a_0 \psi_{l=0} + a_2
\psi_{l=2}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(a_0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(a_2\)</span> are constants such that <span
class="math inline">\(a_0^2 + a_2^2 = 1.\)</span> Then, from the normal
rule of probabilities we have that <span class="math display">\[\mu_d =
a_0^2\mu_{l=0}  +  a_2^2\mu_{l=2}\]</span></p>
<p>Using the experimental value for the magnetic momentum of the
deuteron, <span class="math inline">\(\mu_d\)</span>, then allows us to
determine that <span class="math inline">\(a_0^2 = 0.96\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(a_2^2 = 0.04\)</span>. So the nucleus spends
4% of its time in an <span class="math inline">\(l=2\)</span> state.</p>
<p>This suggests that our description of the nuclear potential wasn’t
quite correct. It turns out that we weren’t quite okay to assume the
wavefunction (and hence the potential) is spherically symmetric. We also
know this from experiments, as the deuteron is found to have a
quadrapole moment (more on this later). But it still gave us a good
first approximation.</p>
<h1 id="why-are-there-no-pp-or-nn-nuclei">Why are there no pp or nn
nuclei?</h1>
<p>We can ask whether we would expect to see nuclei (i.e. bound states)
with 2 protons (pp) or 2 neutrons (nn). Since we don’t observe these in
nature, we need to be able to answer ‘no’!</p>
<p>It might be tempting to explain the non-existence of the pp nucleus
by invoking the Coulomb repulsion; perhaps this is sufficient to modify
the potential so that there is no bound state? However, this turns out
not to be the answer, and in any case wouldn’t help us with the nn
nucleus.</p>
<p>We observe experimentally that the dueteron has total spin of <span
class="math inline">\(j = 1\)</span>, which for the <span
class="math inline">\(l=0\)</span> state must mean that the spins of the
proton and neutron are aligned (giving us s = 1, the triplet state). We
don’t find the deuteron in the s = 0 singlet state, where the spins are
opposite. This suggests that the triplet state is energetically
favourable. It turns out the the nuclear force is stronger between
nucleons with their spins aligned, and in fact for a proton and a
neutron with anti-aligned spins, there are no bound states.</p>
<p>So, in order to obtain a bound pp or nn state, we would need to have
both protons or neutrons in the same spin state. But this is forbidden
by Pauli’s exclusion principle. One would have to be in a higher energy
state, and as already established this would turn out to be an unbound
state, the energy would be too high. So we do not have pp or nn
nuclei.</p>
<p>This also gives us some hints abut what is coming when we start to
consider nuclei with more than 2 nucleons, and what the origin of the
symmetry term in the SEMF might be.</p>
