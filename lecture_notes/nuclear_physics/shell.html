<h1 class="title">Nuclear Physics Section 4 - The Shell Model</h1>
<p class="author">Mike Hughes</p>

<p><em>In this section we move on from deuteron to consider more complex
nuclei and develop the shell model. Now we have no hope of solving the
Schrödinger equation exactly and will need to make some simplifying
approximations.</em></p>
<h1 id="evidence-for-the-shell-model">Evidence for the Shell Model</h1>
<p>We can now extend our treatment to other nuclei and postulate a shell
model. This is a conceptually similar idea to the shell model for atoms.
There is certainly ample evidence for a shell model for nuclei.</p>
<p>Firstly, it is found that nuclei with even number of protons and
neutrons are more stable than those with odd numbers (this was captured
in our pairing term for the SEMF). This suggests that some type of
pairing is going on, similar to the idea of having two electrons per
energy level in an atom. There are certain magic numbers of protons and
neutrons which seem to produce very stable nuclei with high natural
abundances. These magic numbers are: 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82 and 126.
Nuclei which have these numbers of both N and Z are ‘doubly magic’ and
even more stable.</p>
<p>This seems to suggest some sort of ‘filling’ of shells, again
analogous to filling electron shells in an atom. The neutron
cross-section, the probability of these nuclei absorbing a further
neutron, is also lower than for other nuclei.</p>
<p>The liquid drop model does not explain these features, and the
binding energy of magic number nuclei is poorly modelled by the
semi-empirical mass formula.</p>
<h1 id="the-shell-model">The Shell Model</h1>
<p>The shell model makes some basic assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Each nucleon moves in a potential which is the average effect of
all of the other nucleons in the nucleus. This is known as the
<strong>mean field approximation</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The motion of the nucleons means that this potential can be
considered smooth.</p></li>
<li><p>Each nucleon in the nucleus is bound, i.e. each sits inside a
potential well.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a sense in which each nucleon is in an orbit of the
potential well it sits in.</p></li>
<li><p>For the protons, this potential also includes a Coulomb component
due the electrostatic repulsion.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The huge simplification here is that, rather than trying to model
individual interactions between individual nucleons, we are assuming
that each nucleon sees an average ‘net’ potential due to all the other
nucleons. This net potential is then the potential in the Schrödinger
equation. However, as when we modelled the deuteron, we have the problem
that we don’t know exactly what this potential is.</p>
<p>Some experimentation can determined that a good guess for the
potential is to assume that is spherically symmetric and takes the form:
<span class="math display">\[V(r) = - \frac{V_0}{1 + \exp \frac{r-R}{a}}
    \label{eqn:fermiPot}\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(V_0\)</span> is a constant, <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the radial co-ordinate and <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> are constants. You may remember that we
studied this equation in Workshop 1 in a slightly different context, so
you will know that <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is the radius
of the potential and <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is related
to the skin thickness. We can choose <span class="math inline">\(R =
r_0A^{1/3}\)</span> and we determined in the worksheet that a value of
<span class="math inline">\(a\approx 0.5\)</span> fm gives a skin
thickness that matches experiment. The potential energy (well depth)
<span class="math inline">\(V_0\)</span> is again an unknown, so we
would have to try different values until we reproduce experimental
binding energies, it turns out <span class="math inline">\(V_0 =
50\)</span> MeV gives the best results.</p>
<p>The solution to this spherical potential will then have the form:
<span class="math display">\[\Psi =
R_{nl}Y_{lm_l}(\theta,\phi)\]</span></p>
<p>As before, the <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is a radial
component and the <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is the angular
component and these solutions are separable. The solutions for <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> are spherical Bessel functions and the
solutions for <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> are spherical
harmonics. The solutions are parameterised by the principal quantum
number (<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>), the angular momentum
quantum number (<span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>) and the magnetic
quantum number (<span class="math inline">\(m_l\)</span>). Each solution
has an an associated energy, <span class="math inline">\(E_{nl}\)</span>
which depends on <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(l\)</span> but not on <span
class="math inline">\(m_l\)</span>. We say that solutions with different
<span class="math inline">\(m_l\)</span> are degenerate.</p>
<p>The degeneracy of each level, i.e. the number of nucleons that can
have each energy level, is <span class="math inline">\(2(2l +
1)\)</span>, where the initial factor of two allows for the two <span
class="math inline">\(m_s\)</span> spin states and the <span
class="math inline">\(2l + 1\)</span> allows for the different <span
class="math inline">\(m_l\)</span> states.</p>
<p><strong>The important thing to realise that protons and neutrons fill
up their own shells. Protons and neutrons are not identical particles
and so the Pauli exclusion principle doesn’t apply between a proton and
a neutron.</strong></p>
<h2 id="comparison-with-atomic-energy-levels">Comparison with Atomic
Energy Levels</h2>
<p>If we compare with the atomic shell mode, we can also identify two
other important difference:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The energy and radius scales are very different.</p></li>
<li><p>The shape of the potential is different, resulting in a different
distribution of allowed energy levels. In particular, they do not bunch
up so much at higher energies.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We label the levels with a number and a letter, the letter being the
<span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, ... of the spectroscopic notation,
representing <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>. So for example,
<span class="math inline">\(1s\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span>p etc. The <strong>difference with
similar looking notation for atomic energy levels</strong> is that the
number does not indicate the principal quantum number, but the <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>th state of that <span
class="math inline">\(l\)</span>. For example <span
class="math inline">\(2p\)</span> is the second <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(l =
1\)</span>) state. So we see states such as <span
class="math inline">\(1f\)</span> which would not occur in atomic
physics.</p>
<p>Like in atomic physics, the energy-ordering of the levels is not as
nice as we might have hoped, as shown in Table <a href="#tab:levels"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:levels">1</a>. (There is
no need to memorise the order, I would give you this in an exam, but you
would need to known how to work out the degeneracy.)</p>

<p>We would expect nuclei with full shells to be particularly stable,
i.e. these should be the nuclei corresponding to magic numbers of
protons and neutrons. Unfortunately, these totals do not match the
observed magic numbers, so we have not managed to accurately predict
shell-filling effects. Tweaking the potential does not fix this
problem.</p>
<h1 id="spin-orbit-coupling">Spin-Orbit Coupling</h1>
<p>As we discussed previously, the total angular momentum for a nucleus
is a combination of the orbital angular momentum and spin of its
constituents. An effect called ‘spin-orbit’ coupling requires a
modification to the potential.</p>
<p>The modified potential is: <span class="math display">\[V&#39; =
V_{Fermi}(r) - V_{SO}(r)(l \cdot s)
   \label{eqn:SOPot}\]</span> where we have labelled the original
potential from Equation <a href="#eqn:fermiPot"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eqn:fermiPot">[eqn:fermiPot]</a> as <span
class="math inline">\(V_{Fermi}\)</span>. The form of <span
class="math inline">\(V_{SO}\)</span> is not so critical for the magic
numbers, it is the <span class="math inline">\(l \cdot s\)</span> term
which causes a re-ordering of the energy levels.</p>
<p>This new term is attractive when <span
class="math inline">\(l\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> are parallel and repulsive when they
are anti-parallel (we look at this in more detail later). To put it
another way, states for which <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> are anti-parallel are more
tightly bound.</p>
<p>We label states by their total angular momentum, <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{J} = \vec{L} + \vec{S}\)</span>. This means
that the quantum number <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> can
either be <span class="math inline">\(|l - s|\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(l + s\)</span>. (This is derived below).</p>
<p>The simplest way to see what happens is via an example. Consider a
<span class="math inline">\(1f\)</span> state (<span
class="math inline">\(l = 3\)</span>). In this case, spin-orbit coupling
could give us two possible values for the nucleus spin, we could have
<span class="math inline">\(j = |l - 1/2| = 5/2\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(j = l + 1/2 = 7/2\)</span>. We label these states
as <span class="math inline">\(1f_{5/2}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(1f_{7/2}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Each of these states has degeneracy <span class="math inline">\(2j +
1\)</span> (recall that <span class="math inline">\(m_j\)</span> runs
from <span class="math inline">\(-j\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(+j\)</span>):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(1f_{5/2}\)</span> has <span
class="math inline">\(2j + 1 = 6\)</span> states</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(1f_{7/2}\)</span> has <span
class="math inline">\(2j + 1 = 8\)</span> states</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So there are 14 states in total. Before we took into account
spin-orbit coupling we had <span class="math inline">\(2(2l+1) =
2(2[3]+1) =
14\)</span> states. <strong>So, we haven’t created any more
states</strong>. We have just regrouped previously degenerate states
into two groups of different energies.</p>
<p>Calculating the energy levels of these new groups is a little messy
(see <em>Krane p124</em> for details), but when we do work out the new
series of energy levels (Figure <a href="#fig:levels"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:levels">1</a> and Table <a
href="#tab:soshells" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="tab:soshells">2</a>) we find we can reproduce the magic
numbers perfectly. This is a huge vindication for the shell model and
spin-orbit coupling.</p>

<p>We also predict a new magic number of 184 that has not yet been
observed. This ‘island of stability’ could mean super-heavy nuclei with
long decay half-lives. However, they do not occur naturally and the
technology to produce them artificially has not yet been developed.</p>
<h2 id="derivation-of-level-splitting">Derivation of level
splitting</h2>
<p>We can check how <span class="math inline">\(\vec{L}.\vec{S}\)</span>
in Equation <a href="#eqn:SOPot" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eqn:SOPot">[eqn:SOPot]</a> modifies the potential.
Beginning with <span class="math inline">\(\vec{J} = \vec{L} +
\vec{S}\)</span>, from geometry we can also say: <span
class="math display">\[J^2 = L^2 + S^2 - 2\vec{L}\cdot \vec{S}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(J = |\vec{J}|\)</span> and so on.
Re-arranging: <span class="math display">\[\vec{L}\cdot \vec{S} =
1/2(J^2 - L^2 - S^2)\]</span></p>
<p>We parameterise <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> with the
quantum number <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, such that <span
class="math display">\[J^2 = j(j+1)\hbar^2\]</span></p>
<p>For the case where the <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> are aligned, we have <span
class="math inline">\(J = L + S = L + 1/2\)</span> and so: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    J_{(L+S)}^2 &amp;= (l + 1/2)(l + 3/2)\hbar^2 \\
    &amp;=(l^2 + 2l +3/4) \hbar^2
\end{aligned}\]</span> and so <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \vec{L} \cdot \vec{S} &amp;= 1/2[(l^2 + 2l +3/4)\hbar^2 -
l(l+1)\hbar^2 - s(s+1)\hbar^2] \\
    &amp;= 1/2[(l^2 + 2l +3/4)\hbar^2 - l(l+1)\hbar^2 -
1/2(1/2+1)\hbar^2] = (1/2)l \hbar^2
\end{aligned}\]</span> where we have used that <span
class="math inline">\(S = s(s+1)\hbar^2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(L =l(l+1)\hbar^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Similarly for for the anti-aligned, <span class="math inline">\(J = L
- S\)</span>, case we have: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    J_{(L-S)}^2 &amp;= (l - 1/2)(l + 3/2)\hbar^2 \\
    &amp;=(l^2 - 1/4) \hbar^2
\end{aligned}\]</span> and then <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \vec{L} \cdot \vec{S} &amp;= 1/2[(l^2 - 1/4)\hbar^2 - l(l+1)\hbar^2
- s(s+1)\hbar^2] \\
    &amp;= 1/2[(l^2 -1/4)\hbar^2 - (l^2+l)\hbar^2 - 3/4\hbar^2] =
-(1/2)(l+1) \hbar^2
\end{aligned}\]</span> So we can see that there is a difference in sign,
as we would expect, and also a different in the magnitude. The
difference in energy between the split states will therefore be
proportional to: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \Delta_{\vec{L} \cdot \vec{S}} &amp; = (\vec{L}\cdot \vec{S})_{(L +
S)} - (\vec{L}\cdot \vec{S})_{(L - S)}  \\
    &amp;= (1/2) l \hbar^2 - [ -(1/2)(l + 1)\hbar^2] \\
    &amp;= (l + 1/2)\hbar^2
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>

<p><strong>Even-Even nuclei</strong> have spin (i.e. total angular
momentum) of 0 and parity even. This is a very simple rule to apply.</p>
<p>The spin and parity of on <strong>odd-even or even-odd</strong>
nucleus is determined by the single unpaired nucleon. This can be either
a single nucleon in a level, or a single hole in a level. For example,
take <span class="math inline">\(^{15}_8O\)</span>. There are 8 protons,
completely filling to the <span class="math inline">\(1p_{1/2}\)</span>
level. There is one fewer neutron, leaving the <span
class="math inline">\(1p_{1/2}\)</span> level unfilled. This is the
state that determines the spin of the nucleus, <span
class="math inline">\(j = 1/2\)</span>. The unpaired neutron is in the
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> state, which is <span
class="math inline">\(l = 3\)</span>. Recall parity =<span
class="math inline">\((-1)^l\)</span>, so the parity is odd. We write
this state as <span class="math inline">\(^{15}_8O(1/2-)\)</span></p>
<p>For another example, take <span
class="math inline">\(^{17}_8O\)</span>. Now there is a single neutron
in the <span class="math inline">\(1d_{5/2}\)</span> level. So we have
spin <span class="math inline">\(j=5/2\)</span>. The unpaired neutron is
in the <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> state, which is <span
class="math inline">\(l = 2\)</span>. So now the parity is even. So the
state is <span class="math inline">\(^{17}_8 O(5/2+)\)</span>. The
configurations of these two isotopes of oxygen are illustrated in Figure
<a href="#fig:oxylevels" data-reference-type="ref"

possible spin states are shown by up and down arrows; these are arranged

each level. Note that levels are shown for protons (Z) and neutrons (N)
separately. The level with a hole or single neutron determines the spin
and parity of the nucleus.</figcaption>

<p><strong>Odd-odd nuclei</strong> have spin which is sum of the spins
of last two unpaired neutrons and protons. These nuclei are rarely
stable.</p>
<p>Remember, these last three rules only apply for nuclei which are 1
nucleon under or 1 nucleon over a full shell. They also only work
reliably for nuclei in the ground state. Nevertheless, it is another
strong piece of evidence that the nuclear shell model is a good one.</p>
<h1 id="predictions-of-the-shell-model">Predictions of the Shell
Model</h1>
<h2 id="spin-parity-pairing-and-symmetry">Spin, Parity, Pairing and
Symmetry</h2>
<p>In the previous section we saw that the shell model allows us to
predict the ground state spin (<span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>)
and parities for a range of nuclei. In particular, nuclei with even
numbers of both protons and neutrons (<strong>even-even</strong> nuclei)
are found to have <span class="math inline">\(j=0\)</span> and even
parity. This is due to pairing effect, whereby the <span
class="math inline">\(m_j\)</span>s effectively cancel each other out,
leading to no net angular momentum.</p>
<p>For nuclei with odd numbers of one type of nucleon (protons or
neutrons), known as <strong>even-odd nuclei</strong>, we also saw that
in the cases where this led to them being one short or one over filling
a shell, the nuclear spin and parity was equal to the under-filled or
singly-filled shell, respectively.</p>
<p>These pairing effects (or lack thereof) are the origin of the
<strong>pairing term</strong> in the semi-empirical mass formula. Nuclei
with even-even are the most stable, while stable nuclei with odd-odd
configuration are very rare.</p>
<p>The existence of two separate shell structures (protons and neutrons)
goes a good way to explaining the symmetry term in the semi-empirical
mass formula. It is obvious that it will be energetically favourable to
fill up both shell systems rather than to have a large excess of protons
or neutrons.</p>
<p>We also observe experimentally that larger nuclei tend to have an
excess of neutrons. We can explain this by considering the Coulomb
repulsion between protons. This means that the total potential is not
identical for protons and neutron, i.e. they sit in slightly different
potentials with slightly different energy levels. Since the Coulomb
force opposes the nuclear force, the protons sit in a shallower well
with slightly higher energy levels. Hence why we might expect neutrons
levels to fill up slightly faster.</p>
<p>Why does this have more of an effect for heavier nuclei? Recall that
the Coulomb force is proportional to <span class="math inline">\(Z(Z-1)
\approx Z^2\)</span> while the nuclear force is proportional to <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. So for larger nuclei the Coulomb force
is relatively more significant, and so the difference in the energy
levels between the proton and the neutron shells becomes greater.</p>
<h2 id="dipole-and-quadrupole-moments">Dipole and Quadrupole
Moments</h2>
<p>The nuclear magnetic dipole moment is given by: <span
class="math display">\[\mu = \mu_N(g_l L_z + g_sS_z),\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\mu_N\)</span> is the nuclear
magneton (a constant), <span class="math inline">\(g_l\)</span> is the
gyromagnetic ratio associated with orbital angular momentum, <span
class="math inline">\(g_s\)</span> is the gyromagnetic ratio associated
with spin angular moment, <span class="math inline">\(L_z\)</span> is
the z-component of the orbital angular momentum, and <span
class="math inline">\(S_z\)</span> is the z component of the spin. (Note
here that the capital ‘<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>’ and
‘<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>’ have been used to distinguish
the physical quantities from quantum numbers.)</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(g_l\)</span> is a convenient notation to
express the fact that the orbital angular momentum of the proton
contributes to the magnetic dipole moment, but that orbital angular
momentum of the neutron does not (since it is uncharged). Hence <span
class="math inline">\(g_l\)</span> is 1 for protons and 0 for
neutrons.</p>
<p>As discussed previously, the spin of both protons and neutrons does
contribute, with <span class="math inline">\(g_s = 5.59\)</span> for
protons and <span class="math inline">\(g_s = -3.83\)</span> for
neutrons.</p>
<p>Using this model predicts the observed dipole moments very well.</p>
<p>We can also predict electric quadrupole moments. If you are not
familiar with quadrupole moments, essentially we can think of a
progression from a single monopole, through an electric dipole (which
you studied in PHYS5040), which has a separation of charges and hence an
axis, to higher order shapes which have multiple poles. This is
illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:quadrupole"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:quadrupole">3</a>.</p>
<figure id="fig:quadrupole">

<figcaption>Illustration of concepts of monopoles, dipoles and
quadrupoles.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Certain nuclei are found to have large electric quadrupole moments,
beyond anything which could be predicted by the shell model alone. This
suggests that there is some non-spherical-uniformity to these nuclei and
lends support to the idea of the <strong>Collective Model</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="the-collective-model-and-beyond">The Collective Model and
Beyond</h1>
<p>The shell model does not explain all the observed properties of
nuclei. In particular, when we study nuclei in excited states, not all
of the observed energy levels are predicted by the shell model. It turns
out that there are three main ways that a nucleus can be put in an
excited state</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pair-breaking, a single proton or neutron is moved into a higher
energy level, leaving a hole.</p></li>
<li><p>The nucleus gains vibrational energy.</p></li>
<li><p>The nucleus gain rotational energy. This mainly occurs for nuclei
with <span class="math inline">\(150 &lt; A &lt; 190\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(A &gt; 230\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The first way is predicted by the shell model. The vibrational and
rotational energy levels are not predicted by the shell model. Extending
the shell model to include these effects leads to the Collective Model,
so-called because the vibrational and rotational states involve the
whole of the nucleus. We will not study these further, but you can read
more about them in an appendix if you are interested.</p>
<p>In these first four lectures we have made a number of attempts to
model the nucleus, ranging through the SEMF, our finite square well
model of the deuteron, the simple shell model, the introduction of
spin-orbit coupling and finally (briefly) the idea of the collective
model. While all of these models have some success a at predicting
experimental observations, it should be clear that none of them provides
a complete description. They all attempt to simplify what is, in
essence, an incredibly complex quantum-mechanical system of many
interacting bodies. Of course there are many further complicated
refinements to these models which are beyond the scope of this course,
and research continues. Nevertheless, you will find the simple models we
have developed useful we move on to study nuclear reactions and
decays.</p>
