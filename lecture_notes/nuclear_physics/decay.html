<h1 class="title">Nuclear Physics Section 5 - Radioactive Decay</h1>

<p><em>This section looks at alpha, beta and gamma decay. First ensure
you are happy with the basic idea of radioactive decay rates reviewed in
Section 1 and the Q-factor discussed in Section 2.</em></p>
<h1 id="alpha-decay">Alpha Decay</h1>
<p>Some heavy nuclei are found to be unstable to the ejection of a
helium 4-nucleus (2 protons and 2 neutrons), known as alpha decay (<span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-decay). This tends to occur for
heavier nuclei, particularly those where the proton-to-neutron ratio is
too high (recalling that larger nuclei require an excess of neutrons to
overcome the Coulomb force.) The process is spontaneous, i.e. it doesn’t
need to be triggered by anything. Below we will study some basic
properties of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-decay, before
looking at the underlying quantum physics.</p>
<h2 id="energetics">Energetics</h2>
<p>Alpha decay can only occur if the energetics are favourable. We
require that the binding energies of the resultant daughter particles
sum to more than the binding energies of the parent particle. The
generic equation for <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-decay
is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\isotope[A][Z]{X}_N \rightarrow
\isotope[A-4][Z-2]{Y}_{N-2} + \alpha,\]</span></p>
<p>where we can see that the parent nucleus has lost 4 units of atomic
mass number (A) and 2 units of atomic number (Z), and where</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\alpha =
\isotope[4][2]{He}_2.\]</span></p>
<figure id="fig:alpha">
<img src="figs/alpha.png" style="width:1.5in" />
<figcaption>Illustration of parent nucleus, <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, decaying into daughter nucleus, <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, by emission of an <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> particle.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>By conservation of mass-energy: <span class="math display">\[m_X c^2
= m_Y c^2 + T_Y + m_{\alpha}c^2 + T_{\alpha},\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(T_Y\)</span> is the resulting
kinetic energy of the daughter nucleus and <span
class="math inline">\(T_\alpha\)</span> is the kinetic energy of the
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> particle. We define the
Q-factor as the sum of the kinetic energy released <span
class="math display">\[Q = T_Y + T_\alpha,\]</span></p>
<p>such that <span class="math display">\[Q = (m_X - m_Y -
m_\alpha)c^2.\]</span></p>
<p>The total numbers of protons and neutrons does not change, so the
Q-factor really depends on the differences in binding energies between
the parent and daughter particles, <span class="math display">\[Q =
(B_{\alpha} + B_Y - B_X).\]</span></p>
<p>Since we cannot have negative kinetic energy, it must be the case
that <span class="math inline">\(Q &gt; 0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-decay cannot otherwise occur. So
we require that the combined binding energy of the daughter particles is
greater than the parent particle, i.e. they are more tightly bound.
Recalling that binding energy is really a negative thing, this releases
kinetic energy which goes into the daughter particles. This is also
explains why emission of other sized groups of protons and neutrons
mostly does not occur (with one or two rare exception), these are less
tightly bound and hence the calculations for these hypothetical decays
would give <span class="math inline">\(Q &lt; 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>For example, <span class="math display">\[\isotope[228][90]{Th}
\rightarrow \isotope[224][88]{Ra}  + \alpha\]</span></p>
<p>has a Q-value of <span class="math inline">\(5.5~\rm MeV\)</span>,
whereas a decay resulting in the emission of a proton, rather than an
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> particle,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\isotope[228][90]{Th} \rightarrow
\isotope[227][87]{Ac} +   \isotope[1][1]{H}\]</span></p>
<p>has a Q Value of <span class="math inline">\(-6.4~\rm MeV\)</span>,
i.e. it cannot occur.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can see that it is the very high binding energy (i.e
low mass) of an <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> particle
(<span class="math inline">\(\rm 28.3~MeV\)</span>) that is the reason
for this particle to be ejected, since this makes <span
class="math inline">\(Q &gt; 0\)</span> more likely.</p>
<p>Nuclides which decay by <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-decay are those with a deficit of
neutrons (excess of protons) with respect to the line of stability.
(Recall that larger nuclei require <span class="math inline">\(N \approx
1.4Z\)</span> to be stable due to the effect of the Coulomb
interaction). <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-decay moves
the daughter particle slightly closer to the line of stability as the
required excess of neutrons is smaller for lighter nuclei. We usually
find that <span class="math inline">\(Q &gt; 0\)</span> only occurs for
<span class="math inline">\(A &gt; 150\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(Q \approx 6~\mathrm{MeV}\)</span> is typical.</p>
<h2 id="features-of-alpha-decay">Features of Alpha Decay</h2>
<p>We find that there is a structure to the observed kinetic energy of
the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> particles: the energies
are found to take one of a set of discrete energies rather than
continuous spectrum. We also observe an enormous range in the decay
rates of different nuclei by <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-decay. This range is from <span
class="math inline">\(10^{-7} \rm~s\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(10^{10}\rm~years\)</span>, some 24 order of
magnitude. Any model we develop should therefore explain these two
experimental observations.</p>
<p>Geiger and Nuttall found, in 1911, a simple empirical relationship
between the decay constant, <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, and the <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> particle kinetic energy, <span
class="math inline">\(T_{\alpha}\)</span>, <span
class="math display">\[\ln(\lambda) = c\ln(T_{\alpha}) + D\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> are fitted constants. Remarkably, this
relationship holds roughly true over a huge range of decay constants and
energies. This is illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:geiger"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:geiger">2</a>, where it
should be remembered that <span class="math inline">\(t_{1/2} = \ln(2) /
\lambda\)</span>.</p>

<h2 id="alpha-decay-energetics">Alpha Decay Energetics</h2>
<p>Since the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> particle is
much lighter than the daughter nucleus, most of the energy released by
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> decay goes into kinetic
energy of the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> particle (i.e.
<span class="math inline">\(T_\alpha \gg T_Y\)</span>). We can perform
this calculation for a specific decay as follows.</p>
<p>Consider the decay: <span
class="math display">\[\isotope[214][84]{Po} \rightarrow
\isotope[210][82]{Pb} + \alpha\]</span></p>
<p>The binding energies of <span
class="math inline">\(\isotope[214][84]{Po}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\isotope[210][82]{Pb}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> are 1.66601 GeV, 1.64555 GeV, and
28.296 MeV, respectively. The Q-value for this decay is therefore: <span
class="math display">\[Q = B_{Pb} + B_{\alpha} - B_{Po} =
1.64555~\mathrm{GeV} + 28.296~\mathrm{MeV} - 1.66601~\mathrm{GeV} =
7.82~\mathrm{MeV}\]</span></p>
<p>This is positive, as it must be for <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-decay to occur.</p>
<p>If all this energy went to the <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> particle it would have a speed of
<span class="math display">\[v = \sqrt{\frac{2Q}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{2
\times (7.82~\mathrm{MeV})}{3727.37~\mathrm{MeV/c^2}}} = 0.0042c \approx
1260~\mathrm{km/s},\]</span></p>
<p>where we used that <span class="math inline">\(m_{\alpha} =
3727.37~\mathrm{MeV/c^2}\)</span>. The speed, while large, is much less
than <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, and so <strong>no
relativistic corrections are required here</strong>.</p>
<p>In reality, some of the energy will go into kinetic energy of the
daughter nucleus. We can see how much using conservation of momentum.
Working in the rest frame of the parent nucleus, we have: <span
class="math display">\[m_Yv_Y = -m_{\alpha}v_{\alpha},\]</span> where we
have denoted the daughter nucleus with <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Hence the ratio of the speeds is <span
class="math display">\[\frac{v_{\alpha}}{v_Y} =
\frac{m_{Y}}{m_{\alpha}}.\]</span> In the case of the reaction above
this ratio is approximately the ratio of atomic mass numbers, <span
class="math inline">\(210 / 4 \approx 52\)</span>. In terms of energy:
<span class="math display">\[\frac{E_{\alpha}}{E_Y} =
\frac{m_{\alpha}v_{\alpha}^2}{m_Yv_Y^2}  =  \frac{m_{\alpha}}{m_Y}
\frac{m_Y^2}{m_{\alpha}^2} = \frac{m_Y}{m_{\alpha}}.\]</span></p>
<p>and so the same ratio applies, 98% of the energy goes to the <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> particle.</p>
<h2 id="the-coulomb-barrier">The Coulomb Barrier</h2>
<p>To understand the decay rates of different nuclei by <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-decay, we must understand what
prevents nuclei simply decaying in the cases where <span
class="math inline">\(Q&gt;0\)</span>. In order for a single nucleus to
split into a daughter nucleus and an alpha particle, we can imagine an
intermediate state where the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>
particle and the daughter nucleus have just split apart, but are still
close enough for the strong interaction to be a consideration. We can
therefore think of the formed <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> particle sitting in the potential
well of the nucleus, as shown in Fig <a href="#fig:alpha_well"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:alpha_well">3</a>. Note
that here the potential well is due to both the strong nuclear
interaction and the Coulomb interaction.</p>
<p>In order to be free of the nucleus, the <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> particle must pass through a
potential barrier. Classically it does not have sufficient energy, and
this is only possible using quantum mechanical tunnelling, i.e. due to
the wavefunction being non-zero beyond the barrier. (If the energy was
above the barrier than the decay would have happened almost immediately
and we wouldn’t observe it). This explains the random nature of the
decay. It also explains the huge range in decay rates.</p>
<figure id="fig:alpha_well">
<img src="figs/alpha_well.png" style="width:2.5in" />
<figcaption>The <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> particle
sits in a potential well due to interaction with the remainder of the
nucleus. The <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> particle has
energy <span class="math inline">\(E_{\alpha}\)</span>, less than the
height of the Coulomb barrier, <span class="math inline">\(V_C\)</span>.
To be emitted it must tunnel through the Coulomb barrier.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This potential barrier is sometimes called the Coulomb barrier,
although this can be slightly confusing because the Coulomb force is
tending to push the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> particle
away from the nucleus, it is really the strong interaction that needs to
be overcome.</p>
<p>Working semi-classically, we can imagine the <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> particle ‘bouncing’ within the
well, reflecting off the barrier with frequency <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. If the probability of tunnelling
through the barrier at each strike is <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> then the decay rate <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> can be approximated simple as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\lambda = fP.\]</span></p>
<p>We can estimate <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to be roughly
<span class="math inline">\(v/a\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is the speed of the <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> particle as it bounces between the
walls (related simply to its kinetic energy, <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, and mass <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> by <span
class="math inline">\(v=\sqrt{2mK}\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can obtain a rough estimate the height of the barrier by computing
the Coulomb potential between an alpha particle and the daughter nucleus
that are just touching,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[U = k \frac{q_1q_1}{r} = k \frac{
2(Z-2)e^2}{r}\]</span> We obtain an estimate of their radii using <span
class="math inline">\(r = r_oA^{1/13}\)</span> and hence the separation
of their centres when just touching is the sum of the two radii.</p>
<p>For example, for the decay</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\isotope[211][83]{Bi} \rightarrow
\isotope[207][81]{X} + \alpha\]</span> the daughter nucleus has <span
class="math inline">\(A = 207\)</span> and the <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> particle, as always, has <span
class="math inline">\(A=4\)</span>. The two radii can be estimated using
<span class="math display">\[r_X = (1.2~\mathrm{fm})A^{1/3} =
7.1~\mathrm{fm},\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[r_{\alpha} =
1.9 ~\mathrm{fm},\]</span> giving a separation of <span
class="math inline">\(9.0 ~\mathrm{fm}\)</span>.</p>
<p>We then estimate the Coulomb barrier height as <span
class="math display">\[U =k \frac{ 2(Z-2)e^2}{r} = (9\times 10^9)\frac{
2(81-2)(1.6\times 10^{-19})^2}{9\times 10^{-15}} = 4.0\times
10^{-12}~\mathrm{J} = 25~\mathrm{MeV}.\]</span></p>
<p>As expected, this is (several times) larger than the typical kinetic
energies of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> particles (and
so several times larger than the Q-value). Therefore, classically, this
barrier cannot be penetrated (otherwise the decay would be immediate),
and so <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-decay requires
quantum tunnelling. This is what leads to the stochastic (random) nature
of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-decay.</p>
<p>To determine the probability of the <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> particle tunnelling through the
Coulomb barrier we need to solve the Schrodinger equation and hence
integrate the square of the wavefunction beyond the barrier. This is
quite difficult, and you are not expected to do this, but some of the
details can be found in Krane Section 8.4. For interest, the result is
that the probability is given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P=\exp{(-2G)}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, the Gammow factor, is
given by <span class="math display">\[G =
\sqrt{\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}}\int_{a}^{b}[V(r)-Q]^{1/2} dr\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is the radius of the
well, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the distance at which
the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> particle would be
classically free (i.e. its kinetic energy is above the potential), <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is the kinetic energy of the <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> particle, <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is its mass, and <span
class="math inline">\(V(r)\)</span> is the height of the Coulomb
barrier.</p>
<p>The important thing to note here is that the probably depends on the
exponential of the Gammow Factor, which itself depends on the <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> particle energy. This shouldn’t be
surprising, the exponential came up when you studied the finite square
well.</p>
<p>Due to the exponential, small changes in the Q-value therefore lead
to a huge change in the probability and hence a huge change in the decay
rate and half life. In fact a change in the Q-value by a factor of 2 can
change the half life from a tiny fraction of a second to the age of the
Universe.</p>
<h1 id="beta-decay">Beta Decay</h1>
<p>Beta Decay (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-decay) is the
emission of an electron or a positron from the nucleus. If the nucleus
has an excess of neutrons, a neutron can decay into a proton and an
electron - the protons remains in the nucleus and the electron is
emitted. This is referred to as Beta-minus, <span
class="math inline">\(\beta^-\)</span>, decay. Similarly, a proton can
decay in a neutron and a positron, with the positron emitted, known as
Beta-plus (<span class="math inline">\(\beta^+\)</span>) decay. Both of
these decays are mediated by the weak interaction, which you will study
later in the module.</p>
<p>A positron is the anti-particle of an electron, it has identical mass
but opposite charge. The positron will quickly annihilate with any
electron encountered. This results in the emission of two gamma rays,
each of energy 0.511 MeV (the rest energy of the electron/positron)
emitted in (almost) opposite directions. This is convenient for the
technology called Positron Emission Tomography (PET) as detecting these
two photons allows the emission to be localised and hence a 3D image
(tomogram) to be created. Those of you taking Medical Physics will learn
more about this.</p>
<p>Unlike in alpha decay, where discrete values of energy are released,
the emitted electron or positron has a range of possible energies up to
some maximum. The maximum is the Q-value of the decay, i.e.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Q = m_X - m_Y - m_e\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(m_X\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(m_Y\)</span> are the masses of the parent and
daughter nuclei, respectively. As for <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-decay, the Q-value must be
positive, meaning that the daughter nucleus must be more tightly bound
(more stable) than the parent.</p>
<figure id="fig:beta_energy">
<img src="figs/beta_energy.png" style="width:3.5in" />
<figcaption>The electrons or positrons emitted in <span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-decay are found to have a spectra
of energies up to some maximum.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At first sight it is quite strange that the electron/positron does
not take practically all of the energy (with a small amount going to the
much more massive nucleus) - where does it go? This was a mystery for
some time, and led to the discovery of neutrinos.</p>
<h2 id="neutrinos">Neutrinos</h2>
<p>Beta decay is always accompanied by the emission of an electron
neutrino. <span class="math inline">\(\beta^-\)</span> decay results in
the emission of an anti-neutrino, <span
class="math inline">\(\beta^+\)</span> decay results in the emission of
a neutrino. You will study neutrinos in the particle physics section of
the module, but here you should be aware that they are uncharged and
have a very small rest mass (<span class="math inline">\(&lt; 1~\rm
eV\)</span>) We know they must be emitted because:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The neutrino carries away some energy, allowing for the observed
spectrum of energy for the electrons/positrons</p></li>
<li><p>Without the neutrino, we do not conserve spin</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(\beta^-\)</span> decay, the process
is <span class="math display">\[n \rightarrow p + e^- +
\bar{\nu_e},\]</span></p>
<p>while for <span class="math inline">\(\beta^+\)</span> decay, the
process is <span class="math display">\[p \rightarrow n + e^+ +
\nu_e,\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\nu_e\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{\nu_e}\)</span> are the (electron) neutrino
and anti-neutrino, respectively. There is a third possible decay called
electron capture, <span class="math display">\[p + e^-\rightarrow n
+  \nu_e,\]</span> where one of the orbital electrons is absorbed into
the nucleus. This has the same net effect as <span
class="math inline">\(\beta^+\)</span> decay as the positron from the
<span class="math inline">\(\beta^+\)</span> decay will annihilate with
an electron. Positron capture, while technically possible, is hindered
by the lack of positrons in normal environments.</p>
<h2 id="examples-of-decays">Examples of Decays</h2>
<p>In <span class="math inline">\(\beta^+\)</span> decay a nucleus
converts a proton intro a neutron, while in <span
class="math inline">\(\beta^-\)</span> decay a nucleus converts a
neutron into a proton. <span class="math inline">\(\beta^+\)</span>
decay therefore occurs for nuclei with an excess of protons and <span
class="math inline">\(\beta^-\)</span> decay for nuclei with a deficit
of protons with respect to the line of stability. There is no change in
the nucleon number, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p>For example, Cobalt-60 decays into Nickel-60 by <span
class="math inline">\(\beta^-\)</span> decay with a half-life of
5.27 days, reducing its excess of neutrons: <span
class="math display">\[\isotope[60][27]{Co} \rightarrow
\isotope[60][28]{Ni} + e^- + \bar{\nu_e}.\]</span></p>
<p>An example of <span class="math inline">\(\beta^+\)</span> decay is:
<span class="math display">\[\isotope[230][91]{Pa} \rightarrow
\isotope[230][90]{Th} + e^+ +  \nu_e.\]</span></p>
<p>Equivalently, we could have electron capture: <span
class="math display">\[\isotope[230][91]{Pa} + e^- \rightarrow
\isotope[230][90]{Th} + \nu_e.\]</span></p>
<h2 id="beta-decay-chains">Beta Decay Chains</h2>
<p>For a nucleus that is some way from the line of stability, multiple
<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> decays may occur. These take
a slightly different form if the original nucleus has odd or even <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. (Recalling that <span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-decay does not change <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, so the daughter particles will have
the same <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>). The difference can be
explained by reference to the SEMF formula. For a nucleus with odd <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, each decay toggles the nucleus between
being and even-even and an odd-odd nucleus. This leads to a significant
change in binding energy and a ‘zig-zag’ pattern, as shown in Figure <a
href="#fig:beta_paths" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:beta_paths">5</a>. For even <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> nucleus, there are two different
end-points, depending on which decay path was followed. Even though one
of these end-points is lower, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>
decay between them is not possible - <span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-decay takes us from an even-even to
an odd-even, not a different even-even, and going via an odd-even would
decrease the binding energy, i.e. going ‘uphill’.</p>

<h1 id="gamma-decay">Gamma Decay</h1>
<p>We will not study Gamma Decay (<span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-decay) in detail in this module,
but you should know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-decay is the emission
of a photon from the nucleus due to a change in its internal energy
state.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-ray energies range
from a few keV to 8 MeV.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-decay is usually the
by-product of another decay which leaves the daughter nucleus in an
excited state. When the nucleus relaxes to the ground states, a photon
is emitted.</p></li>
<li><p>While <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> decay usually
occurs almost instantly (<span
class="math inline">\(10^{-12}~\mathrm{s}\)</span>), some excited states
are <strong>metastable</strong>, meaning that the <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> emission is delayed by some period
of time. The most famous is Technicium-99m, <span
class="math inline">\(\isotope[99m]Tc\)</span>, where the ‘m’ stands for
a metastable state created when Mo-99 decays via <span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> decay. Technicium-99m has a half
life of about 6 hours and emits photons with an energy of 140 keV, two
properties which turn out to be ideal for use as a tracer for medical
imaging. Those taking medical physics will discover much more about this
when studying nuclear medicine and gamma cameras.</p></li>
