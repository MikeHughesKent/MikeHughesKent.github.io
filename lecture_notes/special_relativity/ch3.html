<p>In this section we will determine some general consequences of the
Lorentz transformations. We will show that, if I am moving relative to
you, my clock will appear to you to be running slow by a factor of <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, and that my length in the
direction of motion will contract by a factor of <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>. However, from my point of view,
it is <em>you</em> who is moving, and <em>your</em> clock that will run
slow and <em>you</em> that will be length contracted. It might seem that
this leads to paradoxes - how can your clock run slower than mine if
mine is running slower than yours?. We will explore the resolution of
this (and other) apparent paradoxes, and see that framework of special
relativity is in fact, entirely consistent (and, as far as we know,
correct).</p>
<h1 id="the-light-clock">The Light Clock</h1>
<p>The light clock is a thought experiment which provides an
introduction to time dilation without using the Lorentz transformations,
and can provide an intuitive explanation of why we must abandon notions
of absolute time if the postulates of special relativity are to be
accepted.</p>
<p>Imagine a pair of mirrors, with a pulse of light bouncing between
them. Each time light hits a mirror, we can think of this as the tick of
a clock, and we measure the time interval between two of these ‘ticks’.
The distance between the mirrors we call <span
class="math inline">\(h\)</span>.</p>
<figure id="fig:lightClock">
<img src="Pictures/clock.png" />
<figcaption>The light clock as observed by an observer moving with the
clock (left, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>) or relative to the
clock (right, <span class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span>).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For an observer in the frame of reference of the light clock (i.e.
someone who is not moving with respect to the light clock), which we can
call <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, then the time taken for the
pulse to pass between the mirrors is given by <span
class="math inline">\(t=h/c\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is the speed of light, as normal in
classical mechanics.</p>
<p>An observer who is in a frame of reference moving with a velocity
<span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> with respect to the light clock
sees the light travel in a zig-zig pattern, as illustrated below. Let’s
assume they measure the time between ticks to be <span
class="math inline">\(t&#39;\)</span>. In <span
class="math inline">\(t&#39;\)</span> the light clock will have moved a
distance of <span class="math inline">\(ut&#39;\)</span>. So, from
Pythogras’ theorem, the pulse of light has travelled a distance <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(d^2 =
h^2 + (ut&#39;)^2\)</span>. It travels this distance in a time <span
class="math inline">\(t&#39; = d/c\)</span>, and so substituting in
<span class="math inline">\(d=ct&#39;\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(h=ct\)</span> from above we obtain: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
c^2t&#39;^2 &amp;= c^2t^2 + u^2t&#39;^2 \\
t&#39;^2(c^2 - u^2) &amp;= c^2t^2 \\
t&#39;^2 &amp;= t^2 \frac{c^2}{c^2 - u^2} \\
t&#39; &amp;= t\sqrt{\frac{1}{1-u^2/c^2}} \\
t&#39; &amp;= \gamma t
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>As we will see below, this is exactly the time dilation equation.</p>
<h1 id="statement-of-time-dilation">Statement of Time Dilation</h1>
<p>Consider a time period, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta
T\)</span>, measured in a particular frame of reference. For example,
this could be the time between two ticks of a clock, as measured by
someone who is not moving relative to the clock (i.e. in the same frame
of reference as the clock). This is therefore a time interval between
two events measured on a clock that is present at both events. We call
this the <strong>proper time</strong>.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>The <strong>proper time</strong> is the time measured by a clock in
its rest frame.</p>
</div>
<p>Now think about the point-of-view of an observer in a different
reference frame who has their own clock. So for them, the original clock
is moving. During a tick of the moving clock, the time interval measured
by the observer on their clock will be: <span
class="math display">\[\Delta t = \gamma \Delta \tau\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is the normal gamma
factor and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \tau\)</span> is the time
interval measured on the moving clock in that clock’s <em>rest
frame</em>. Since <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is always
bigger than 1, then they will always measure a bigger time interval on
their clock. So moving clocks appears to be running slow.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>Time Dilation means that, in a reference frame in which it is moving,
a clock runs slow by a factor of <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> compared with its rest frame.</p>
</div>
<p>We sometime write the proper time as <span
class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="time-dilation-from-lorentz-equations">Time Dilation from Lorentz
Equations</h1>
<p>The time dilation equation comes quite simply from the Lorentz
transformations. Imagine a bulb that regularly flashes, say at 1 second
intervals. We can think of this as a simple kind of clock. Let’s call
the time between flashes <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span>,
as measured by the clock (or someone in the same rest frame of the
clock, which we will call <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>). The
first flash we will label event 1, and the second flash event 2.</p>
<p>In <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> the bulb is not moving, it
is always at the same place, so we can say: <span
class="math display">\[x_1 = x_2 = 0\]</span></p>
<p>We’ll call the time of the first flash <span
class="math inline">\(t_1 = 0\)</span> and the second flash <span
class="math inline">\(t_2 = \Delta t\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now let’s use the Lorentz transformations to figure out what someone
who is moving with respect to the bulb, in frame <span
class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span>, sees: <span
class="math display">\[t&#39;_2 = \gamma(t_2 -
\frac{ux_2}{c^2})\]</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(x_2=0\)</span> this is simply <span
class="math display">\[t&#39;_2 = \Delta t&#39; = \gamma \Delta
t.\]</span> This is the same as the time dilation equation (albeit with
slightly different nomenclature).</p>
<h1 id="solving-time-dilation-problems">Solving Time Dilation
Problems</h1>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Time Dilation of a Spacecraft:</strong> A spaceship sets out
from Earth at a speed of <span class="math inline">\(c/4\)</span>. The
ship reaches its destination after 1 year as measured by the clock of an
observer on Earth. How much time does the pilot of the spaceship measure
the trip took on his clock?</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> To solve this problem we can either start
from the Lorentz transformations or, with a little thought, simply use
the time dilation equation, <span class="math inline">\(t=\gamma
t_0\)</span>. First, we know that <span
class="math inline">\(u=c/4\)</span> so we can calculate <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\gamma &amp;= \sqrt{\frac{1}{1-u^2/c^2} }\\
&amp;= \sqrt{\frac{1}{1-(1/4)^2}} \\
&amp;= 1.03
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Define <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> as the Earth rest
frame, <span class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span> as the spaceship rest
frame.</p></li>
<li><p>The first event is the spaceships leaving, which we will set to
be at <span class="math inline">\(x_0 = x_0&#39; = 0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(t_0=t_0&#39; =0\)</span> (i.e. the common origin
of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span>).</p></li>
<li><p>The second event is the spaceship arriving. Hence <span
class="math inline">\(t = 1\)</span> year and <span
class="math inline">\(t&#39;\)</span> is the wanted unknown.</p></li>
<li><p>The location of the arrival event is <span
class="math inline">\(x&#39;=0\)</span> (since spaceship does not move
in its frame of reference) and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is
unknown and not needed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Possible Lorentz transformations to use are <span
class="math inline">\(t&#39; = \gamma(t - ux/c^2)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(t = \gamma(t&#39; + ux&#39;/c^2)\)</span>. Since
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is unknown, use <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    t &amp;= \gamma(t&#39; + ux&#39;/c^2) \\
    &amp;= \gamma(t&#39; + 0) \\
    &amp;= \gamma t&#39; \\
    1~\mathrm{yr} &amp;= 1.03t&#39;\\
    t&#39;&amp;= 0.97~\mathrm{yrs}
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>If we want to start straight from the time dilation equation (<span
class="math inline">\(t = \gamma t_0\)</span>), we need to be careful to
work out which time is <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and which
is <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span>. Recall that <span
class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> is the proper time, it is the time
measured by a clock in a reference frame where the clock is not moving.
However, it is very easy to get confused when working with this
definition.</p>
<p>It is easier if we <strong>think in terms of events</strong>. Event
1, in this case, was the spaceship leaving Earth, and Event 2 was the
spaceship arriving at its destination. For somebody on Earth, these two
events are at different locations. For somebody on the spaceships these
two events are at the same location. So, it is the spaceship that
measures the proper time (<span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>). We
therefore have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
t &amp;= \gamma \tau \\
1~\mathrm{yr} &amp;= (1.03)\tau \\
\tau &amp;= 0.97~\mathrm{years}
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Another way to think about it is that the for an observer on Earth,
the spaceship is moving. Therefore the observer sees their moving clock
run slow, i.e it will tick up less time than the clock on Earth.</p>
<p>The confusion comes because the observer on the spaceship also sees
the Earth’s clock run slow. The question doesn’t ask you about this, but
you see how you can easily get it confused. <strong>So, if in doubt,
start with the Lorentz transformations</strong>; providing you carefully
define your reference frames then you can’t really go wrong.</p>
<h1 id="statement-of-length-contraction">Statement of Length
Contraction</h1>
<p>Consider a rod of length <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, as
measured in its rest frame (i.e. by an observer who is not moving
relative to the rod).</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>The <strong>proper length</strong> is the length of an object
measured in its rest frame.</p>
</div>
<p>For an observer in a reference frame where the object is moving, the
length of the object along the direction of motion will reduce by a
factor of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[L = \frac{L_0}{\gamma},\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(L_0\)</span> is the length of the object in its
<em>rest frame</em>. This is called <strong>length contraction</strong>
or Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>In a reference frame in which it is moving, the length of an object
reduces by a factor of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>
relative to its length in its rest frame.</p>
</div>
<h1
id="demonstration-of-length-contraction-from-lorentz-equations">Demonstration
of Length Contraction from Lorentz Equations</h1>
<p>Consider an observer, in frame <span
class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span>, moving past a rod. We will call
the rest frame of the rod <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. We
will synchronise clocks as the observer passes the front of the rod, and
call this event 1, so that: <span class="math display">\[x_1 = 0, \quad
t_1 = 0, \quad x&#39;_1 = 0, \quad t&#39;_1 = 0\]</span> At exactly the
same time, the moving observer measures the position of the back of the
rod, <span class="math inline">\(x&#39;_2\)</span>. Their measurement of
the length of the rod, <span class="math inline">\(L&#39;\)</span>, is
<span class="math display">\[L&#39; = x&#39;_2 - x&#39;_1 = x&#39;_2 - 0
= x&#39;_2\]</span></p>
<p>Since the measurements must be made at the same time <span
class="math display">\[t&#39;_1 = t&#39;_2 = 0\]</span></p>
<p>Finally, we know that in the rod’s rest frame the distance between
the front and back of the rod is its length, i.e. <span
class="math display">\[L = x_2 - x_1 = x_2 - 0 = x_2\]</span></p>
<p>Now we can use the Lorentz transformation: <span
class="math display">\[x_2 = \gamma(x&#39;_2 + ut&#39;_2)\]</span> and
since <span class="math inline">\(t&#39;_2 = 0\)</span>, we have <span
class="math inline">\(x_2 = \gamma x&#39;_2\)</span> and hence: <span
class="math display">\[x&#39;_2 = \frac{x_2}{\gamma},\]</span> or <span
class="math display">\[L&#39; = \frac{L}{\gamma},\]</span> as we wanted.
Now, you might wonder, what would happen if we used the inverse
transform <span class="math display">\[x&#39;_2 = \gamma(x_2 -
ut_2)\]</span> If we say <span class="math inline">\(t_2 = 0\)</span>
then we would have <span class="math inline">\(x&#39;_2 = \gamma
x_2\)</span> and so <span class="math inline">\(L&#39; = \gamma
L\)</span>! rather than <span class="math inline">\(L&#39; =
\frac{L}{\gamma}\)</span>, and they can’t both be right!</p>
<p>The answer is that we have absolutely no business saying that <span
class="math inline">\(t_2 = 0\)</span>. We said that in the frame of the
observer, <span class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(t&#39;_2 = 0\)</span> because we were setting
<span class="math inline">\(t&#39;_2 = t&#39;_1\)</span>. To measure the
length of something that is moving, we have to compare the positions of
the front and the back <em>at the same time</em>.</p>
<p>However, there is nothing to say that these two times are equal in
<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. You could work out <span
class="math inline">\(t_2 = \gamma(t&#39;_2 - ux&#39;_2)\)</span> of
course, substitute this in, and you would get the correct answer, but
it’s a bit more maths.</p>

m passes by an observer at a speed of <span

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> The proper length is 100 m, so we expect

<h1 id="muon-flight-time">Muon Flight Time</h1>
<p>An experimental demonstration of the effect of time dilation on Earth
comes from muons. Muons are particles created in the upper atmosphere
from the decay of pions, at a height of several thousand kilometres.
They are unstable, and themselves decay with a half life of around <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span> μs.</p>
<p>A typical muon moving at <span
class="math inline">\(u=0.998c\)</span> only travels around <span
class="math inline">\(600\)</span> m in <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span> μs. Therefore, since the distance that
needs to be travelled is several times this, very few muons should reach
the Earth’s surface. However, we actually a significantly larger flux of
muons reaching the Earth’s surface than expected.</p>
<p>This is explained by time dilation. The <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span> μs is a proper time interval, i.e. it
is the time measured from the rest frame of the muon (the muon is at the
event of the muon’s creation and the event of it reaching the Earth’s
surface, so it must measure the proper time). From the point of view of
us on earth, however, the muons experience time dilation. At a velocity
of <span class="math inline">\(0.998c\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is about <span
class="math inline">\(15\)</span>, meaning that the observer on earth
sees the internal ‘clock’ of the muon seem to run 15 times slower. To
put it another way, the decay half life increases by a factor of 15.</p>
<p>But what happens if we look at things from the rest frame of the
muon. From here it is the Earth that is moving towards the muon at a
speed of <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>. So the muon sees time
running more slowly for the Earth, it obviously does not see it own
clock running slow - its proper time does not change, and it is the
proper time that determines the decay rate.</p>
<p>The answer is length contraction. In the rest frame of the muon, the
Earth is moving towards it at a speed of <span
class="math inline">\(0.998c\)</span>. The distance that it has to
travel is therefore length contracted by a factor of <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma = 15\)</span>. Therefore, while the muon
still decays in <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> μs, now it only
has to travel a distance of <span class="math inline">\(L/15\)</span>
before hitting the Earth.</p>
<p>The fact that something that looks time dilation in one frame of
reference can look like length contraction in another tells us something
about the inter-connectedness of space and time, that in a sense we are
looking at two different aspects of the same thing. We will explore this
idea of ‘spacetime’ more in the next lecture.</p>
