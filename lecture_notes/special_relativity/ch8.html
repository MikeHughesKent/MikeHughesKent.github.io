<h1 class="title">Section 8 - Relativistic Energy</h1>

<p>In this final lecture we will discuss one more relativistic
correction - to energy. As we will see, while this correction is not
quite as straightforward as the one for momentum, it has hugely
important consequences, leading us to discover the equivalence between
mass and energy.</p>
<h2 data-number="1" id="non-relativistic-kinetic-energy"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Non-Relativistic Kinetic
Energy</h2>
<p>In non-relativistic Newtonian mechanics, the kinetic energy of an
object is defined as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E_K = \frac{1}{2} mv^2,\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the object’s mass and
<span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is its velocity. As with
momentum, this is the definition that we choose for kinetic energy
precisely because it is this quantity which is conserved (providing we
take into account all other types of energy in the system). Since <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is frame-dependent, we expect <span
class="math inline">\(E_K\)</span> to also be frame dependent.</p>
<h2 data-number="2" id="relativistic-kinetic-energy"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Relativistic Kinetic Energy</h2>
<p>Based on the pattern we have seen so far, we might hope that
relativistic energy might be as simple as <span
class="math inline">\(E_K=(1/2) \gamma m_0v^2\)</span>. However, this is
not the case. Instead, it is something very strange looking indeed.</p>
<div class="framed">
<p><span class="math display">\[E_K = (\gamma  - 1) m_0c^2.\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Firstly, we need not worry that there is no <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> in there, for this is hidden inside
<span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>.</p>
<p>Before we work out where this equation comes from, let’s check our
requirement that this reduces to the familiar form for <span
class="math inline">\(v \ll c\)</span>. It is not a simple as saying
that <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = 1\)</span> because then we
have <span class="math inline">\(E_K = 0\)</span> which is what we want
for <span class="math inline">\(v=0\)</span>, but doesn’t tell us
anything about small but non-zero values of <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span>.</p>
<p>To get there, we instead make use of the binomial expansion. For
small values of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, i.e <span
class="math inline">\(|x| \ll 1\)</span>, <span
class="math display">\[(1-x)^{-1/2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x}} \approx 1 +
x/2.\]</span></p>
<p>If we expand out <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> in the
equation for relativistic kinetic energy, we have <span
class="math display">\[E_K = \bigg(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}} -1\bigg)
m_0c^2.\]</span></p>
<p>Then, using the binomial expansion, we obtain <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    E_k &amp;= (1 + v^2/2c^2- 1)m_0c^2 \\
    E_k &amp;=(1/2)m_0v^2,
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>which is exactly the non-relativistic expression for kinetic energy.
So once again, it turns out that our familiar definition is really an
approximation which is good only for <span class="math inline">\(v \ll
c\)</span>.</p>
<h2 data-number="3"
id="derivation-of-relativistic-kinetic-energy-not-examinable"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> Derivation of Relativistic
Kinetic Energy (Not Examinable)</h2>
<p>To derive the equation for relativistic energy we need to recall that
the change in kinetic energy of an object is given by the integral of
the force applied over the distance it is applied through, i.e.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E_K = \int F ds,\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is the force and <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is the distance. Secondly, we recall
that force is equal to the rate of change in momentum:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[F = \frac{dp}{dt}.\]</span></p>
<p>Therefore, if we consider an object that has accelerated from rest to
a velocity <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, the kinetic energy is
given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E_K = \int^{v=v}_{v=0} \frac{dp}{dt}
ds.\]</span></p>
<p>Now, <span class="math inline">\(ds/dt\)</span> is simply velocity,
<span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, so</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E_K = \int^{v=v}_{v=0}
v~dp,\]</span></p>
<p>and relativistic momentum is given by <span
class="math inline">\(p=\gamma m_0 u\)</span>, so that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E_K = \int^{v=v}_{v=0}
vd\bigg(\frac{m_0v}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}\bigg) = \int^{v=v}_{v=0}
v~d\bigg[(m_0v)\bigg(1-\frac{v^2}{c^2} \bigg)^{-1/2}\bigg],\]</span></p>
<p>where we have expanded out <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>.</p>
<p>We want to get this integral in terms of <span
class="math inline">\(dv\)</span> so that we can integrate and apply the
limits. To do this, we can use the chain rule to show that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\frac{d}{dv} \bigg[(m_0v)\bigg(1-\frac{v^2}{c^2} \bigg)^{-1/2}\bigg]
&amp;= m_0\bigg(1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}\bigg)^{-1/2} +
m_0\frac{v^2}{c^2}\bigg(1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}\bigg)^{-3/2}.
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>If we divide the first term top and bottom by <span
class="math inline">\((1-v^2/c^2)\)</span> to put everything over a
common denominator we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[d\bigg[(m_0v)\bigg(1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}
\bigg)^{-1/2}\bigg] =
m_0\bigg(1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}\bigg)^{-3/2}~dv.\]</span></p>
<p>Substitute this back into the equation for <span
class="math inline">\(E_K\)</span> and we get</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E_K = \int m_0 \bigg(1-
\frac{v^2}{c^2}\bigg)^{-3/2}v~dv.\]</span></p>
<p>This integral can be solved using the substitution <span
class="math inline">\(w=\sqrt{1 / (1-v^2/c^2)}\)</span>, to give</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E_K = \frac{m_0c^2}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}} -
m_0c^2,\]</span></p>
<p>and so</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\boxed{E_K = (\gamma -
1)m_0c^2}\]</span></p>
<p>which is the expression for relativistic kinetic energy.</p>
<h2 data-number="4" id="total-energy"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> Total Energy</h2>
<p>If we expand out our newly discovered expression for kinetic
energy</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E_K = \gamma m_0c^2 -
m_0c^2,\]</span></p>
<p>we notice that it consists of one quantity subtracted from another.
We might wonder what these two terms represent physically. As we will
show below, it turns out that this equation really means:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\textrm{kinetic energy =  total energy -
rest energy}\]</span></p>
<p>and so,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\boxed{E_{total} = \gamma
m_0c^2}\]</span></p>
<h2 data-number="5" id="rest-energy-and-mass-energy-equivalence"><span
class="header-section-number">5</span> Rest Energy and Mass-Energy
Equivalence</h2>
<p>In the rest frame of the object, where <span
class="math inline">\(v=0\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma = 1\)</span> and so</p>
<div class="framed">
<p><span class="math display">\[E=m_0c^2\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>This shows that a non-moving object, i.e. an object viewed from its
rest frame, still has some energy. We call this the <strong>rest
energy</strong>.</p>
<p>We see that this rest energy depends only on the mass, <span
class="math inline">\(m_0\)</span>, and a constant, <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. Since mass and energy are linked by a
fixed constant, this demonstrates an equivalence between the two. In
particle accelerators we can see this in action, as kinetic energy is
converted to rest energy, and hence rest mass. So if we smash two
particles together with a certain total rest mass, <span
class="math inline">\(m_0\)</span>, it doesn’t follow that the rest mass
of a new particle created must be equal to <span
class="math inline">\(m_0\)</span>.</p>
<h2 data-number="6" id="energy-and-mass-units"><span
class="header-section-number">6</span> Energy and Mass Units</h2>
<p>The SI Unit for energy is the Joule, J. However, the kinds of objects
we most often observe moving at speeds which are an appreciable fraction
of <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> (and hence where the effects
of special relativity become noticeable) tend to be particles (for
example in a particle accelerator). In this case, the Joule is not a
sensible unit to use. Instead we use electron-volts (eV).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[1~\mathrm{eV} = 1.6
\times  10^{-19}~\mathrm{J}\]</span></p>
<p>(This comes from the energy gained by an electron moving across a
voltage of 1 V, but that isn’t important here.)</p>
<p>Since we know that rest mass is equivalent to rest energy, linked by
the constant <span class="math inline">\(c^2\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(E_0=m_0c^2\)</span>, we can also specify the rest
mass in eV type units.<br />
A particle with a rest energy of <span
class="math inline">\(1~\mathrm{eV}\)</span> would have a rest mass of
<span class="math inline">\(1~\mathrm{eV/c^2}\)</span>.<br />
In practice we will actually find ourselves working with larger units of
energy and mass, in which case we will talk about <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{MeV}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{MeV/c^2}\)</span>, or <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{GeV}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{GeV/c^2}\)</span><br />
We can also use these kinds of units for momentum. Recall that <span
class="math inline">\(p=\gamma m_0v\)</span>. If we specify mass in
<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{MeV/c^2}\)</span> and velocity as a
fraction of <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, then we can specify
our momentum in units of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{MeV/c}\)</span>.<br />
Using these kinds of units makes dealing with mass/energy/momentum
problems in particle physics and relativity much simpler (since the
<span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>s also cancel out) and <strong>you
should be very comfortable with them going into the exam.</strong></p>
<h2 data-number="7" id="example-energy-and-momentum-calculations"><span
class="header-section-number">7</span> Example Energy and Momentum
Calculations</h2>
<p><em>A neutron has a rest mass of <span
class="math inline">\(940~\mathrm{MeV/c^2}\)</span> and is travelling at
0.9c. What is its rest energy, total energy, kinetic energy and
momentum?<br />
</em></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the rest mass is <span
class="math inline">\(940~\mathrm{MeV/c^2}\)</span>, then to get the
rest energy we use <span class="math inline">\(E=mc^2 =
(940~\mathrm{MeV/c^2})c^2  = 940~\mathrm{MeV}\)</span>.<br />
</p></li>
<li><p>The total energy is given by <span class="math inline">\(E=\gamma
mc^2\)</span>. For <span class="math inline">\(v=0.9c\)</span> then
<span class="math inline">\(\gamma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1 -0.9^2}} =
2.294\)</span>.<br />
</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore <span class="math inline">\(E =
(2.294)(940~\mathrm{MeV}/c^2)c^2 = 2156~\mathrm{MeV}\)</span>.<br />
</p></li>
<li><p>Then, <span class="math inline">\(E_K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 = E -
mc^2 = 2156~\mathrm{MeV} - 940~\mathrm{MeV} =
1316~\mathrm{MeV}\)</span>.<br />
</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, <span class="math inline">\(p=\gamma mv =
(2.294)(940~\mathrm{MeV}/c^2)(0.9c) = 1940
~\mathrm{MeV/c}\)</span>.<br />
</p></li>
<li><p>Note here that MeV units have been used throughout, making the
problem much simpler.</p>

<h2 data-number="8"
id="demonstration-that-massless-particles-travel-at-the-speed-of-light"><span
class="header-section-number">8</span> Demonstration that Massless
Particles Travel at the Speed of Light</h2>
<p>It is sometimes useful to write energy in terms of momentum. In
classical mechanics, since <span
class="math inline">\(E_K=(1/2)mv^2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(p=mv\)</span>, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E = \frac{p^2}{2m}\]</span></p>
<p>The relativistic equivalent is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E^2 = p^2c^2 + m_0^2c^4\]</span></p>
<p>We can see this by recognising that <span
class="math inline">\(p=\gamma m_0v\)</span> and so <span
class="math inline">\(p^2 = \gamma^2m_0^2v^2.\)</span> So we can
write</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[c^2p^2 =
\gamma^2m_0^2c^4\frac{u^2}{c^2}.\]</span></p>
<p>From <span class="math inline">\(\gamma^2 = 1/(1-u^2/c^2)\)</span>, a
bit of algebra shows us that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[c^2p^2 = \gamma^2 m_0^2c^4 -
m_0^2c^4.\]</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(E=\gamma m_0c^2\)</span>, the first
term is simply <span class="math inline">\(E^2\)</span>, giving us</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\boxed{E^2 = p^2c^2 +
m_0^2c^4}\]</span></p>
<p>This is an important equation which relates the total energy, rest
energy and momentum of a particle (without explicitly including the
velocity). When the energy is much greater than the rest energy, it
becomes <span class="math inline">\(E\approx pc\)</span>.</p>
<p>Continuing, from <span class="math inline">\(E=\gamma m_0
c^2\)</span> and p = <span class="math inline">\(\gamma
m_0v\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[p = \frac{Ev}{c^2}\]</span></p>
<p>Now, if we consider a massless particle, so that <span
class="math inline">\(m_0=0\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(E^2=p^2c^2\)</span> and we have the exact
equation</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E=pc.\]</span></p>
<p>Substituting in <span class="math inline">\(p=Ev/c^2\)</span> gives
us</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E = \frac{Evc}{c^2}\]</span></p>
<p>which immediately tells us that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[v = c.\]</span></p>
<p><strong>This shows that massless particles must have a velocity equal
to <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, the speed of
light!</strong></p>
<p>If we look more carefully, and remember <span
class="math inline">\(m_0 = 0\)</span>, then we see we had a division by
zero when we calculated <span class="math inline">\(p=Ev/c^2\)</span>
(and if <span class="math inline">\(v=c\)</span> then <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is undefined!). So this
‘derivation’, as we have presented it, is not entirely convincing.
However, it turns out that <span class="math inline">\(p=Ev/c^2\)</span>
<em>is</em> true when <span class="math inline">\(m_0=0\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(v=c\)</span>, in which case the only
possible reconciliation with <span class="math inline">\(E=pc\)</span>
is that <span class="math inline">\(v=c\)</span>. More on this will have
to wait until you learn about the energy-momentum 4-vector!</p>
