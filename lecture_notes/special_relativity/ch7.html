<h1 class="title">Section 7 - Relativistic Momentum</h1>

<p>In this lecture we will discuss further implications of special
relativity on momentum. Since momentum is dependent on velocity, it’s
not surprising that our non-relativistic definition will need to be
modified.</p>
<h2 id="non-relativistic-momentum">Non-Relativistic Momentum</h2>
<p>In Newtonian mechanics, momentum is defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[p = mv\]</span></p>
<p>At first glance, there is no obvious reason why the thing that we
call momentum should be defined in this way. Why not define momentum to
be <span class="math inline">\(p = m/v\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(p=mv^8\)</span>? The reason that momentum is
defined as <span class="math inline">\(mv\)</span> is because this value
is <em>conserved</em>. More generally, the total value of the momentum,
summed over all objects, is conserved for any system that has no
external forces acting on it.</p>
<p>To take a simple example, consider two blocks, each with a mass of
<span class="math inline">\(1\,\rm kg\)</span>. One is stationary, and
the other is moving towards it at a velocity of <span
class="math inline">\(10\,\rm m/s\)</span>, as shown in the diagram in
Figure <a href="#fig:momentum" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:momentum">1</a>.</p>
<figure id="fig:momentum">
<p><img src="pictures/collision.png" style="width:12cm"
alt="Illustration of before and after a collision between two blocks. The left diagram shows the two blocks moving together, A moving to the right with speed 10 metres per second and B stationary. The right diagram shows the blocks after the collision, with A moving to the left with speed 5 metres per second and the speed of B is unknown." /></p>
<figcaption>Before and after a collision between two blocks. The left
diagram shows the two blocks moving together, A moving to the right with
speed <span class="math inline">\(10 \, \rm m/s\)</span> and B
stationary. The right diagram shows the blocks after the collision, with
A moving to the left with speed <span class="math inline">\(5 \, \rm
m/s\)</span> and the speed of B unknown.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The total momentum of the system before the two blocks collide is
given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
p &amp;= m_1v_1 + m_2v_2 \\
&amp;= (1~\mathrm{kg})(10~\mathrm{ms^{-1}}) + (1 ~\mathrm{kg})(0) \\
&amp;= 10 \; ~\mathrm{kgms^{-1}}
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>After the collision, the total momentum will still be equal to <span
class="math inline">\(10 \, \rm kgm/s\)</span>. So if, for example, the
left-most block bounces back at <span class="math inline">\(5 \, \rm
m/s\)</span>, the second block must have a velocity <span
class="math inline">\(v_2\)</span> such that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
p &amp;= 10~\mathrm{kgms^{-1}} = (1~\mathrm{kg})(-5~\mathrm{ms^{-1}}) +
(1~\mathrm{kg})v_2 \\
v_2 &amp;= 15 \; \mathrm{ms^{-1}}
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Using the Galilean transformation between inertial frames, if
momentum is conserved in one frame of reference then it will also be
conserved in another. This doesn’t mean that we calculate the same value
of momentum for different reference frames. If an object is moving at
<span class="math inline">\(2 \, \rm m/s\)</span> in frame <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(4 \,
\rm m/s\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span>, then
since <span class="math inline">\(p=mv\)</span>, the value for momentum
will be different in <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span>. But within <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, a certain value of momentum, <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, will be conserved (i.e. not change),
and within <span class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span> a different value
of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> will be conserved.</p>
<p>Given that momentum conservation is such as well-established
principle, we might hope that it continues to be conserved after we make
relativistic transformations between reference frames. Unfortunately, in
the way we have defined momentum, after we make velocity transformations
between reference frames, momentum conservation will no longer be true
for at least one of the frames. Below, we will show that this is the
case, and then make a new definition of momentum, that reduces to the
classical definition for <span class="math inline">\(u &lt;&lt;
c\)</span>, but which is also correctly conserved in relativistic
frames.</p>
<h2 id="breakdown-of-momentum-conservation-not-examinable">Breakdown of
Momentum Conservation (Not Examinable)</h2>
<p>To see that momentum as defined classically is not conserved in
relativistic situations, consider the situation shown in Figure <a
href="#fig:momentumBA" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:momentumBA">2</a>. There are two balls, ball A and
ball B which are going to collide. We will consider two reference
frames, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span>. <span
class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span> is moving with respect to <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> with a velocity <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> along the x-axis.</p>
<p>In reference frame <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, A is
moving directly up the y-axis with velocity <span
class="math inline">\(v_{A,y}\)</span>. In reference frame <span
class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span>, B moving directly down the y-axis
(i.e. it has zero x-velocity) with velocity <span
class="math inline">\(v_{B,y} = -v_{A,y}\)</span>.</p>
<figure id="fig:momentumBA">
<p><img src="pictures/momentum.png" style="width:8cm"
alt="Collision between two balls, A and B, viewed from two different frames of reference, S and S Prime. The x and y axes are drawn for each frame. In S, before the collision A is moving up and B is moving diagonally down and right. After the collision A is moving down and B is moving up and to the right. In S Prime, before the collision B is moving down and A is moving diagonally up and to the right. After the collision, A is moving diagonally down and to the left while B is moving up." />
<span id="fig:momentumBA" data-label="fig:momentumBA"></span></p>
<figcaption>Collision between two balls, A and B, viewed from two
different frames of reference, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Let’s consider what happens in reference frame <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. We know the y-velocity of A, but we
don’t know the y-velocity of B in this frame, only in <span
class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span>. In classical mechanics, <span
class="math inline">\(v_y = v_y&#39;\)</span>, and so ball B simply has
the opposite velocity and momentum to ball A. After a totally elastic
collision, they would each then have the opposite velocity and momentum
in the y direction.</p>
<p>In the relativistic case, however, we must use the relativistic
velocity transform <span class="math display">\[v_y =
\frac{v_y&#39;}{\gamma(1+uv_x&#39;/c^2)}.\]</span> Ball B has no
x-velocity in <span class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span>, so <span
class="math inline">\(v_x&#39; = 0\)</span>, and so we simply have:
<span class="math display">\[v_y = \frac{v_y&#39;}{\gamma}\]</span> Or,
to put it another way, the y-velocity of B is smaller than that for A,
and so the total momentum in the y-direction is not zero (it is positive
because A, which is moving in the +y direction has more positive
momentum than has B has negative momentum). But after the collision, the
y-components of the velocity are reversed. Now there is more momentum in
the -y direction, and so momentum is not conserved. Therefore, the
classic definition of momentum is only approximately conserved for <span
class="math inline">\(u &lt;&lt; c\)</span>. We need to work out a
relativistic correction to momentum to recover its more general
conservation.</p>
<h2 id="relativistic-momentum">Relativistic Momentum</h2>
<p>The relativistic momentum of an object, measured in a reference frame
in which the object is moving at velocity <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, is given by:</p>
<div class="framed">
<p><span class="math display">\[p = \gamma m_0 v\]</span></p>
<p>Gamma is defined almost the same as before: <span
class="math display">\[\gamma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2}}\]</span>
<strong>except that we are using <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>
rather than the velocity of the reference frame, <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span>.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>We have also introduced a new concept, the rest mass, <span
class="math inline">\(m_0\)</span>.</p>
<div class="framed">
<p>The <strong>rest mass</strong> of an object is its mass measured in
its rest frame (the frame of reference in which it is not moving).</p>
</div>
<p>This implies that mass of an object is effectively different in
different reference frames. We could think about defining this
relativistic mass as something like <span class="math inline">\(m =
\gamma m_0\)</span>, but we tend not to write it this way unless we are
writing the full equation for relativistic momentum. As ever, for low
velocities, we have <span class="math inline">\(\gamma \approx
1\)</span> and so we recover the non-relativistic equation for
momentum.</p>
<h2 id="an-argument-for-relativistic-momentum">An Argument for
Relativistic Momentum</h2>
<p>We can motivate <span class="math inline">\(p=\gamma m_0 v\)</span>
in the following way. Since <span class="math inline">\(v=dx/dt\)</span>
we can write</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[p = m_0v = m_0\frac{dx}{dt}\]</span></p>
<p>When we change reference frame, then now <span
class="math inline">\(dt&#39; \neq dt\)</span>. However, the proper
time, <span class="math inline">\(d\tau\)</span>, (the time measured in
the object’s reference frame) doesn’t change with the reference frame.
So, let’s define:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[p = m_0 \frac{dx}{d\tau}.\]</span></p>
<p>This is fine because in the rest frame of the object (<span
class="math inline">\(\gamma = 1\)</span>), we have <span
class="math inline">\(dt=d\tau\)</span> by definition, so this is in
agreement with non-relativistic physics in the limit <span
class="math inline">\(v \ll c\)</span>. More generally, for any
reference frame, <span class="math inline">\(dt = \gamma d\tau\)</span>,
so we straight-away see that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[p = m_0 \gamma \frac{d x}{d t} = \gamma
m_0 v.\]</span></p>
<p>This isn’t a true derivation of course, since we chose <span
class="math inline">\(p=m_0(dx/d\tau)\)</span> without any real
justification, but it shows that this is a plausible definition for
relativistic momentum</p>
