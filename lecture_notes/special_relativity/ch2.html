<h1 class="title">Section 2 - The Lorentz Transformations</h1>

<p>In this lecture we will resolve the problem we discovered in Lecture
1 in applying the Galilean transforms to electromagnetic radiation and
the speed of light. We will do this by modifying the transformations in
such a way that they reproduce the familiar classical results at low,
everyday velocities, but also allow for the observation that light
appears to travel at the same velocity in every reference frame.</p>
<h1 id="the-postulates-of-special-relativity">The postulates of special
relativity</h1>
<p>Einstein proposed two postulates. (Postulates are things that we
<em>assume</em> are true as the basis for a theory which we then compare
with experiment). The postulates are sometime written in slightly
different ways, but in essence are:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li><p>The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames, one
cannot detect one’s absolute velocity by conducting any
experiment.</p></li>
<li><p>The speed of light is independent of the source, and is constant
in all reference frames.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Together, these statements are not compatible with the Galilean
velocity transformations stated in Lecture 1. Consider the following: I
am travelling on a train at <span class="math inline">\(50\,\rm
m/s\)</span> , and you are standing by the side of the track. If I throw
a ball forwards along the train at <span class="math inline">\(10\, \rm
m/s\)</span> you will say the velocity of the ball is <span
class="math inline">\(50 + 10 = 60\,\rm m/s\)</span>. This is simply
applying the velocity transformations.</p>
<p>But now let’s say I do the same thing, except rather than throwing a
ball, I shine light from a torch along the direction the train is moving
in. The second postulate says that, from my point of view, the speed of
light is equal to <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. If we apply
the velocity transforms, the speed you measure would be <span
class="math inline">\((c + 50\,\rm m/s\)</span>. But the second
postulate says that you also measure the speed of light to be equal to
<span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. Therefore, if we accept the
postulates, then we need to modify the Gailean transformations.</p>
<p>In Chapter 1, we stated the Galilean transformations between two
inertial frames of reference, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span>, to be:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[x&#39;=x-ut
\\y&#39;=y
\\z&#39;=z
\\t&#39;=t\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[x=x&#39;+ut&#39;
\\y=y&#39;
\\z=z&#39;
\\t=t&#39;\]</span></p>
<p>We know that these equations work well for most objects that we
interact with, so the modified form of the equations must be such that
they still give (approximately) the same answer for situations where we
know the Galilean transformations work.</p>
<h1 id="statement-of-the-lorentz-transformations">Statement of the
Lorentz Transformations</h1>
<p>The correct transformations between reference frames are called the
Lorentz transformations. They had been discovered before Einstein’s
paper by Lorentz as a somewhat <em>ad hoc</em> solution to the problem
of the Michelson-Morley experiment, although Lorentz still very much
believed in the ether. The transformations are:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span class="math display">\[x&#39;=\gamma (x-ut)
\\y&#39;=y
\\z&#39;=z
\\t&#39;=\gamma(t-ux/c^2)\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[x=\gamma(x&#39;+ut&#39;)
\\y=y&#39;
\\z=z&#39;
\\t=\gamma(t&#39;+ux&#39;/c^2)\]</span></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\gamma =
\sqrt{\frac{1}{1-u^2/c^2}}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> term is the ‘Lorentz
factor’, often simply called <strong>gamma</strong>. Sometimes, we also
define <span class="math inline">\(\beta = u/c\)</span> to simplify
equations, such that <span class="math inline">\(\gamma =
\sqrt{1/(1-\beta^2)}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Notice that to switch between the two sets of equations (primed to
non-primed and non-primed to primed) is simply a matter of replacing
<span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(-u\)</span>. That is to be expected, after all
there is nothing special about which set of co-ordinates we call <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and which we call <span
class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can check that the Lorentz transformation do indeed reduce to the
Galilean transformations for most situations within our experience. The
key thing to notice is the <span class="math inline">\(u^2/c^2\)</span>
in the gamma term (and also the <span
class="math inline">\(ux/c^2\)</span> in the equations for <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(t&#39;\)</span>). <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is a very large number, <span
class="math inline">\(3\times10^8 \,\rm m/s\)</span>, whereas most
velocities we deal with tend to be quite small.</p>
<p>For example, if we go back to our <span class="math inline">\(50
\,\rm m/s\)</span> train, <span class="math inline">\(u^2/c^2\)</span>
is of the order of <span class="math inline">\(10^{-14}\)</span>. So if
we calculate <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[\gamma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1-u^2/c^2}} =
\sqrt{\frac{1}{1 -10^{-14}}}  \approx 1\]</span></p>
<p>So if <span class="math inline">\(\gamma \approx 1\)</span>, then
<span class="math inline">\(x&#39; \approx x - ut\)</span>, which is the
same as the Galilean transformation. More generally we can say that
<span class="math inline">\(\gamma \rightarrow 1\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(u \ll c\)</span>. Similarly, for the <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> transformation, assuming <span
class="math inline">\(ux \ll c^2\)</span> we similarly have <span
class="math inline">\(t \approx t&#39;\)</span>. So, at the kinds of
speeds we typically experience, the Galilean and Lorentz transformation
give essentially the the same result. We therefore only need to use the
more complicated Lorentz transformations when we have speeds are some
reasonable fraction of <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="derivation-of-the-lorentz-transformations">Derivation of the
Lorentz Transformations</h1>
<p>We now show that the Lorentz transformations are the only
transformations that are consistent with the two postulates of special
relativity.</p>
<p>We will assume that space is isotropic and homogeneous. That is to
say that the laws of physics do not depend on the direction we are
moving in or where we are in space. If that is the case then we can
write the most general possible transformation between two inertial
frames as <span class="math display">\[x&#39; = \gamma(x-ut)
\\x = \gamma(x&#39;+ut&#39;)\]</span> Note that we are calling the
constant <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, but at this point
in the derivation we don’t know what <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is yet!</p>
<p>Why must they take this form? They must be linear, i.e. they cannot
contain some power of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. If they contained a power of <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> then this would violate homogeneity.
This means that <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> cannot be a
function of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (although it may be a
function of <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>). There cannot be a
constant term since this would violate isotropy. And for the same reason
the two transforms (i.e. for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(x&#39;\)</span>) must be identical except
for exchanging <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(-u\)</span>.</p>
<p>Prior to the development of special relativity we would have said
that time is measured the same in both frames of reference, and hence
<span class="math inline">\(t=t&#39;\)</span>. If we substitute that
into the equations above, the only way to make it work is if <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma=1\)</span>. This gives us the Galilean
transformations.</p>
<p>But now let’s abandon the constraint that <span
class="math inline">\(t=t&#39;\)</span> and see what happens. Moving to
the second postulate, we have that light travels at the same velocity in
both <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span>. So if we imagine a pulse of light
moving in <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> at <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> the distance it will travel in time
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is simply given by <span
class="math inline">\(x=ct\)</span>. In reference frame <span
class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span> we similarly have that <span
class="math inline">\(x&#39;=ct&#39;\)</span>. Notice that there is no
<span class="math inline">\(c&#39;\)</span>, the second postulate says
that light travels at <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> in all
reference frames (i.e. <span
class="math inline">\(c&#39;=c\)</span>).</p>
<p>Now, if we substitute <span class="math inline">\(x=ct\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(x&#39;=ct&#39;\)</span> into our general
transformations, we have: <span class="math display">\[ct&#39; =
\gamma(ct-ut) = \gamma t(c-u)
\\ct = \gamma(ct&#39;+ut&#39;) = \gamma t&#39;(c+u)\]</span> From the
second equation we have <span class="math display">\[t = \gamma t&#39;
\frac{(c+u)}{c}.\]</span> Substitute this into the first equation and we
have <span class="math display">\[ct&#39; = \gamma \frac{[\gamma t&#39;
(c+u)](c-u)}{c}.\]</span> The <span
class="math inline">\(t&#39;\)</span> on both sides cancel, and we can
multiply both sides by <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> to get
<span class="math display">\[c^2 = \gamma^2(c+u)(c-u).\]</span> Now,
<span class="math inline">\((c+u)(c-u)\)</span> is equal to <span
class="math inline">\(c^2-u^2\)</span> and so we have <span
class="math display">\[\gamma^2 = \frac{c^2}{c^2-u^2}.\]</span> So,
dividing through the right hand side by <span
class="math inline">\(c^2\)</span> and taking the square root we have
<span class="math display">\[\boxed{\gamma =
\sqrt{\frac{1}{1-u^2/c^2}}}\]</span> which is exactly the <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> factor in the Lorentz
transformations.</p>
<p>We can then obtain an expression for <span
class="math inline">\(t&#39;\)</span> by substituting <span
class="math inline">\(x&#39; = \gamma(x-ut)\)</span> into <span
class="math inline">\(x = \gamma(x&#39;+ut&#39;)\)</span> giving <span
class="math display">\[x = \gamma^2x - u\gamma^2t + u\gamma
t&#39;.\]</span> From this point you could solve this directly for <span
class="math inline">\(t&#39;\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> by substituting in the expression for
<span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>. Alternatively, we can
rearrange to obtain <span class="math display">\[t&#39;= \gamma t -
x\frac{\gamma^2 - 1}{u\gamma}.\]</span> We then need to know the
following identity, which can be found from the definition of <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, <span
class="math display">\[\gamma^2 - 1 = \frac{u^2}{c^2}\gamma^2.\]</span>
Substituting in this expression for <span class="math inline">\(\gamma^2
- 1\)</span> leads directly to <span
class="math display">\[\boxed{t&#39; = \gamma\bigg(t -
\frac{ux}{c^2}\bigg)}\]</span> which again is what we want. We have
therefore shown that the Lorentz transformations are the
<strong>only</strong> possible transformations consistent with the
postulates of special relativity.</p>
<h1 id="working-with-the-lorentz-transformations">Working with the
Lorentz Transformations</h1>
<p>If we know the space and time co-ordinates of an event in one
reference frame <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> (<span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>) then we can use the Lorentz
transformations to calculate its space and time co-ordinates (<span
class="math inline">\(x&#39;\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(t&#39;\)</span>) in another reference frame, <span
class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span>, providing we know the velocity,
<span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> which <span
class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span> is moving with relative to <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. Bear in mind that, when not otherwise
stated, we are assuming that we are working in our standard co-ordinate
system, where the two observers agree that <span class="math inline">\(t
= t&#39;\)</span> at the instant when the zero of the <span
class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span> frame moves past the zero of the
<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> frame.</p>
<p>Another factor to keep in mind is the light travel time. When we talk
about the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> co-ordinates of an
event being measured by an observer, we don’t mean the time at which an
observer would see the event if they were looking at it through a
telescope, This is because it would take some amount of time for the
light to travel from the event to the observer and her telescope. This
is <em>not</em> what the Lorentz transformations are telling us about.
The Lorentz transformations tell us what the observer would measure even
if they corrected their measurement to allow for the travel time of the
light. To put it another way, special relativity is not telling us about
some apparent change in time due to the time it takes light to travel,
but a real physical effect.</p>
<p>One way this is sometimes expressed is to imagine a reference frame,
<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span>, as being an infinite lattice of
clocks, moving rigidly together, with all the clocks perfectly
synchronised. The Lorentz transformations tell us what would be measured
by a clock in the lattice that is located at the event, not what an
observer looking at that clock through a telescope would see.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Lorentz Transformation Problem</strong> A spaceship departs
Earth at a constant speed of <span class="math inline">\(c/2\)</span>.
After 1 year (by the pilot’s clock) the pilot measures an explosion
which is 1 light year directly ahead. According to an observer on Earth,
how long after the spacecship left did the explosion occur, and how far
was is from Earth?<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Solution:</strong></em><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Let’s define <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> = Earth frame
and <span class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span> = spaceship
frame.</p></li>
<li><p>The spaceship leaves the Earth at time <span
class="math inline">\(t_0 = t_0&#39; = 0\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The event occurs at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>
as measured on Earth and time <span
class="math inline">\(t&#39;\)</span> as measured on the spaceship, at
locations <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x&#39;\)</span>, respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>So in <span class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span>: <span
class="math inline">\(x&#39;\)</span> = 1 ly, <span
class="math inline">\(t&#39;\)</span> = 1 year</p></li>
<li><p>And in <span class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span>: <span
class="math inline">\(x&#39;\)</span> = ?, <span
class="math inline">\(t&#39;\)</span> = ?</p></li>
<li><p>And we have <span class="math inline">\(u = c/4\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>To find the time measured from Earth: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    t &amp;= \gamma(t&#39; + ux&#39;/c^2) \\
      &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}} (t&#39; + ux&#39;/c^2) \\
      &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(1/2)^2}} (1 \mathrm{[yr]} + 1/2
\mathrm{[yr]}) \\
      &amp;= 2\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\frac{3}{2}~\mathrm{yrs}\\
      &amp;= \sqrt{3}\approx 1.7~\mathrm{yrs}
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>If you’re wondering where the <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>s
went, one cancels with the <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> in the
velocity (<span class="math inline">\(c/2\)</span>). The other converts
the distance in light years to a time in years.</p>
<p>To find the distance measured from Earth, we similarly use: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    x &amp;= \gamma(x&#39; + ut&#39;) \\
    &amp;= 2\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \bigg(1~\mathrm{[ly]} +
(c/2)(1~\mathrm{[yrs]}) \bigg) \\
    &amp;= 2\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} (3/2~\mathrm{[ly]}) \\
    &amp;= \sqrt{3}\approx 1.7~\mathrm{ly}  
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
