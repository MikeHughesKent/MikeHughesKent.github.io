<h1 class="title">Section 1 - Galilean Relativity and the Ether</h1>
<p class="author">Mike Hughes</p>
<p class="date">Physics and Astronomy, University of Kent</p>
</header>
<p>In 1905 Albert Einstein published his classic paper <em>"On the
Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies"</em>. This was the birth of special
relativity, although it was not given that name at the time. By the end
of this course you should be able to follow much of the kinematical part
of this paper (or at least the English translation of it - see the link
on Moodle).</p>
<p>Einstein’s ideas were quickly built on by Hermann Minkowski and
others and - despite special relativity’s apparently counter-intuitive
predictions - it almost immediately gained acceptance as the correct
physical theory describing the relationship between space and time.
Together with the later theory of general relativity, which we will not
study in this course, it has since been experimentally verified to an
extraordinary degree of accuracy.</p>
<p>We will follow a quasi-historical approach to learning the theory,
beginning in this lecture by exploring the classical notions of
relativity and the Galilean transformations between reference frames.
You need to be very comfortable dealing with transformations between
reference frames before moving on. We will then discover a fundamental
incompatibility between these ideas and the electromagnetic theory which
was developed in the mid-18th century. Attempts to resolve this
discrepancy by introducing the idea of the ‘ether’ failed, leading us in
the next lecture to the derivation of the Lorentz transformations, to
the discovery of time dilation and length contraction, and to a
breakdown in our notions of absolute simultaneity.</p>
<p>In later lectures we will encounter the more modern idea of
‘spacetime’ and the invariant spacetime interval. We will discover that
we must modify our definitions of momentum and energy, and we will show
that there is an equivalence between energy and mass, leading to perhaps
the most famous physics equation of all: <span
class="math inline">\(E=mc^2\)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="frames-of-reference-and-events">Frames of Reference and
Events</h1>
<p>A frame of reference can be thought of, informally, as a
‘<em>point-of-view from which a measurement is made by an
observer’</em>. We will study how measurements made by observers in
different reference frames are related to one another. The measurements
will be, initially, of the locations and times at which events occur,
and the spatial and time intervals between the events.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>An <strong>event</strong> is something that happens at a particular
point in space and time (its co-ordinates). Observers in different
reference frames will measure different co-ordinates for the event.</p>
</div>
<p>We will deal mostly with non-accelerating reference frames, i.e.
observers who are not accelerating. These non-accelerating reference
frames are called <strong>inertial reference frames</strong>.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>An <strong>inertial frame of reference</strong> is a frame of
reference in which the laws of mechanics hold good, i.e. a body remains
at rest or moves with a constant velocity unless acted upon by a
force.</p>
</div>
<p>We can tell we are in an inertial reference frame because we don’t
feel ‘pseudo forces’. For example, think of when you are in an
accelerating car, and you seem to feel a force pushing you back onto the
seat (sometimes known as ‘G-forces’). In inertial reference frames we
don’t have these extra forces, the simple laws of mechanics hold;
whenever we see an acceleration we also see a force that causes that
acceleration (<span class="math inline">\(F=ma\)</span>).</p>
<p>A person in an inertial frame of reference, i.e. moving at a constant
speed, cannot tell that they are moving except by reference to other
objects. That is, <strong>no experiment can tell you what your absolute
velocity (or speed) is</strong>, only your velocity or speed relative to
something else. For example, if you are standing on the ground and
looking at a train going past, you will measure it to have a speed of
<span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> in a certain direction. But from
the point of view (the frame of reference) of someone on the train, they
are not moving, and it is the Earth and you moving at a speed of <span
class="math inline">\(-u\)</span> relative to them. This is the
Principle of Relativity, which predates the theory of special relativity
by several hundred years.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>The <strong>Principle of Relativity</strong> states that no
experiment can determine the absolute velocity of a frame of reference.
Only relative velocities between different frames of reference can be
measured.</p>
</div>
<p>It’s also useful to define what we mean by a ‘rest frame’ at this
point.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>The <strong>rest frame</strong> of an object is the frame of
reference in which it is not moving (i.e. its velocity is zero).</p>
</div>
<h1 id="transformation-between-inertial-reference-frames">Transformation
between Inertial Reference Frames</h1>
<p>If we measure the co-ordinates of an event in two different reference
frames, we can convert between those measurements using
<strong>transformations</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s return to our example of a train passing by someone standing by
the side of the tracks. For the driver and the observer we will define
two reference frames and co-ordinate systems. We could define these in
all sorts of ways, and of course it wouldn’t change the physics, but
there is particular way of defining things which makes the problems we
will encounter as simple as possible.</p>
<p>The scheme we will use is shown in Figure <a href="#fig:refFrames"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:refFrames">1</a>.</p>
<figure id="fig:refFrames">
<img src="pictures/frames.png" />
<figcaption>Frames of reference <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span>. <span
class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span> is moving with speed <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> along the x-axis of frame <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. At time <span class="math inline">\(t
= 0\)</span>, the origins of the two frames coincide, at all other times
(<span class="math inline">\(t &lt; 0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(t &gt; 0\)</span>) they do not (providing <span
class="math inline">\(u \ne 0\)</span>)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We call the reference frames, and their associated co-ordinate
systems, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> for the observer and
<span class="math inline">\(S’\)</span> (which we say ‘S prime‘) for the
driver. We will measure the location and time at which events occur from
both reference frames. For the location of the event, we will use
standard Cartesian co-ordinate systems:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> for the driver’s frame of reference,
<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>;</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(x’\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(y’\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(z’\)</span> for the trackside observer’s frame,
<span class="math inline">\(S’\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will align the two co-ordinate frames, so that <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is parallel with <span
class="math inline">\(x&#39;\)</span> and so on. The motion of the
train, and hence the <span class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span>
reference frame, is along the x-axis of frame <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, in the positive direction, with speed
<span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>.</p>
<p>We will also have co-ordinates for the time of the event, which we
will call <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(t&#39;\)</span> for the two reference frames.
Again, for simplicity, we’ll set time <span
class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(t&#39;=0\)</span> at the point where the train
passes the trackside observer. In Newtonian physics, everyone
experiences time the same, so for now we have that <span
class="math inline">\(t=t&#39;\)</span> at all times anyway, but later
on we will find something quite different.</p>
<p>Now let’s imagine some event occurring, the driver sneezing for
example. Recall that an event is something that can be described by
space and time co-ordinates - it happens at a certain place at a certain
time. An event does not <em>belong</em> to a reference frame; it can be
<em>measured or observed</em> from different reference frames.</p>
<p>To define the co-ordinates of this event we need to know its location
in space and time (i.e. where and when it happened). In the co-ordinate
system of the train driver, that is straightforward. For simplicity we
will say the driver is at <span
class="math inline">\((x&#39;,y&#39;,z&#39;) = (0,0,0)\)</span>, i.e. at
the origin of his reference frame, which we call <span
class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, what is the spatial location and time of the sneeze (the
‘event’) from the point of view (i.e. in the rest frame) of the observer
by the side of the track?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The train is moving past at speed <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, so after an amount of time <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> the car will have moved <span
class="math inline">\(ut\)</span> along the x-axis.</p></li>
<li><p>So, the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> co-ordinate of the
event will simply be <span class="math inline">\(x&#39; +
ut\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The train has not moved along the y and the z-axes, and so <span
class="math inline">\(y=y&#39;\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(z=z&#39;\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Time is the the same for everyone, <span
class="math inline">\(t=t&#39;\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We can now write down the full set of equations to transform the
co-ordinates of event measured in frame <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> into the co-ordinates measured in frame
<span class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span> and vice versa. These are
known as the Galilean transformations.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
x&#39;&amp;=x-ut
\\y&#39;&amp;=y
\\z&#39;&amp;=z
\\t&#39;&amp;=t
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
x&amp;=x&#39;+ut&#39;
\\y&amp;=y&#39;
\\z&amp;=z&#39;
\\t&amp;=t&#39;
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Notice that when going from <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> to
<span class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span> we have a <span
class="math inline">\(-ut\)</span> rather than a <span
class="math inline">\(+ut&#39;\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(+ut\)</span>. This is because, from the point of
view of the train driver, the observer is moving backwards along the
x-axis. Otherwise the equations are the same. It is a requirement of the
principle of relativity that the transformations going from <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span> are the same as those going from
<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span> (except for the sign change).</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Train and Tracks Example:</strong> A train passes a man
standing by the tracks at a velocity of 10 m/s. 10 s after it passes
him, the train sounds its horn. How far away does the man by the tracks
measure the horn to be when it sounds?</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>
be man’s frame, <span class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span> be the train
frame.<br />
In <span class="math inline">\(S:\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> = ?, <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> = ?<br />
In <span class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span>: <span
class="math inline">\(x&#39;\)</span> = 0 m, <span
class="math inline">\(t&#39;\)</span> = 10 s<br />
Therefore: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        x &amp;= x&#39; + ut&#39; \\
        &amp;= 0 + (10\,\mathrm{m/s})(10\,\mathrm{s}) \\
        &amp;= 100\,\mathrm{m}
    
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Now let’s imagine that the driver of the train leans out of the
window and throws a ball along the x-axis, with a speed <span
class="math inline">\(v&#39;\)</span> relative to himself and the train.
How fast does the observer think the ball is moving (<span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span>)? You can probably guess straight away
that she sees the speed of the ball added to the speed of the train,
i.e. <span class="math inline">\(v=v&#39;+u\)</span>, where we remember
that <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is the speed of the train
relative to the track-side observer. Thinking of this in terms of the
speeds along the x, y and z axes, we have the Galilean velocity (speed)
transformations:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
v_x&#39;&amp;=v_x-u
\\v_y&#39;&amp;=v_y
\\v_z&#39;&amp;=v_z
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
v_x&amp;=v_x&#39;+ u
\\v_y&amp;=v_y&#39;
\\v_z&amp;=v_z&#39;
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>These can also be obtained simply by differentiating the Galilean
transforms with respect to time, which is left a simple exercise.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Ball on a Train Example:</strong> The train driver from the
same train as above (moving at <span class="math inline">\(10\, \rm
m/s\)</span>) throws a ball out of the window along the direction of the
train’s motion at <span class="math inline">\(5\,\rm m/s\)</span>
relative to himself. What speed does the man at the side of the track
measure the ball to have?<br />
<strong>Solution:</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> be
man frame, <span class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span> be train
frame.<br />
In <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>: <span
class="math inline">\(v_x\)</span> is unknown.<br />
In <span class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span>: <span
class="math inline">\(v_x&#39; = 5~\mathrm{ms^{-1}}\)</span><br />
Therefore: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}

<h1 id="the-speed-of-light">The Speed of Light</h1>
<p>It has been known since the experiments of Ole Römer in the 17th
century that light travels with a finite speed. Successive measurements
over the years have succeeded in fixing the value in a vacuum, known as
<span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, at approximately <span
class="math inline">\(3\times10^8\)</span> m s<sup>−1</sup>. But what is
this relative to?</p>
<p>As an analogy, we know that sound travels in air at approximately
<span class="math inline">\(300\)</span> m s<sup>−1</sup>, and much
faster in other, denser materials. Sound is a wave in a medium. So it is
reasonably that the velocity is relative to the medium (e.g. air,) and
indeed this is what we find experimentally. The speed of sound does not
depend on the speed of the source of the sound, and so if the source is
travelling through the air faster than the speed of sound, it’s possible
for it to overtake sound - this is the effect responsible for the sonic
boom heard from supersonic jets. Conversely, inside a sealed plane, the
air is moving along with the plane, so sound will continue to travel at
<span class="math inline">\(300\)</span> m s<sup>−1</sup> relative to
the passengers.</p>
<p>Unlike for sound, where we have an obvious medium supporting the
sound wave, it is not clear what light is a wave <em>in</em> , since
light travels through a vacuum.</p>
<p>In 1862, James Clark Maxwell discovered that light is in fact an
electromagnetic wave - a wave in electric and magnetic fields. He showed
that the speed of light can be predicted from the fundamental equations
describing electricity and magnetism, known as Maxwell’s Equations.
Crucially, when deriving the wave equation, no account is taken of
relative velocities, and we don’t define a carrying medium. Maxwell’s
equations, unlike Newton’s laws, do not appear to remain the same when
moving between reference frames using the Galilean transformations. So
it would be possible to determine we are moving by making measurements
of electrical and magnetic phenomena. In particular, our ‘absolute
speed’ could be determined simply by measuring the speed of light in our
reference frame. For example, if we measure the speed of light to be
<span class="math inline">\(c + 10\)</span> m s<sup>−1</sup> that means
we are moving at <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>
m s<sup>−1</sup> relative to this absolute reference frame.</p>
<h1 id="the-ether">The Ether</h1>
<p>If an absolute reference frame were to exist (we will soon see it
does not), what form would it take? One idea was that there is some
medium called the ether which fills the universe, and it would be this
is the material in which light waves travel. The ether, if it existed,
would allow light waves to travel at very high speed but also seems to
be undetectable - we cannot feel it and it seems not to slow objects
down that are moving through it. It does, however, apparently solve the
problem of the relativity of the speed of light: the speed of light is
fixed relative to the ether.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as we will now see, the idea of the ether doesn’t
work, or rather, it contradicts the results of experiments in ways that
are seemingly impossible to resolve.</p>
<h1 id="experiments-to-detect-the-ether">Experiments to Detect the
Ether</h1>
<p>In the second half of the nineteenth century, a number of experiments
were performed with the intention to detect the presence of the ether,
or more specifically our motion through it. We shall discuss only one,
the Michelson-Morley experiment, as it is both simple to understand and
definitive.</p>
<p>The assumption behind the experiment is that, if the Earth is moving
relative to the ether, this would mean that we would measure different
speeds of light depending on the relative speed of the Earth. If we
measure the speed of light along the direction of the Earth’s motion, we
should get a different value than if we measure the speed of light
moving perpendicular to the Earth’s motion. Furthermore, since the Earth
is in orbit around the Sun, we would expect that the speed of the Earth
relative to the ether changes throughout the year. If at one point in
the year the Earth is moving at <span class="math inline">\(v\, \rm
m/s\)</span>, then sixth months later, on the other side of the orbit,
it will be moving at <span class="math inline">\(-v\,\ rm m/s\)</span>.
So if we measure the speed of light relative to the Earth, we should
obtain different values.</p>
<p>This was the idea behind the Michelson-Morley experiment. Clearly it
is quite difficult to measure the speed of light because it is so fast.
However, it can be done (and could be even in 1895) with a technique
called interferometry, as illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:mm"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:mm">2</a>. This idea is to
split light into two arms of the interferometer. Light bounces of a
mirror in each arm and is then recombined. Light is a wave and so,
providing the lengths of the two arms are the same, we see interference
effects, giving rise to light and dark fringes. These fringes are very
sensitive to the travel time of the light (either due to a change in its
speed or a change in the length of one of the arms).</p>
<figure id="fig:mm">
<img src="pictures/mm.jpg" />
<figcaption>Michelson-Morley experiment. A simplified diagram of the
interferometer is shown in the left. On the right, the Earth is shown at
four positions in its orbit of the Sun, where it should have four
different velocities with respect to the ether, indicated by the
arrows.</figcaption>

<p>The idea then is to set up the interferometer and observe the
fringes. Then, rotate the interferometer by 90 degrees and look at the
fringes again. If the speed of light is different in the two directions,
the fringes will change. To avoid the possibility that the experiment
happened to be carried out at the point in the Earth’s orbit where it
had zero speed relative to the ether, it can be repeated six months
later.</p>
<p>No difference in the speed of light was measured. Regardless of which
way around the interferometer was, or what time of year the measurements
were made, the speed of light was always measured to be the same. To put
it another way, light does not follow the rules for velocity
transformations, <em>in every reference frame light appears to travel at
<span class="math inline">\(c\)</span></em>!</p>
<p>How could this be explained? One possibility was that the ether is
somehow dragged along with the Earth on its orbit, so that the
experiment was always measuring the speed of light relative to the
moving ether. On practical grounds it becomes hard to explain this, and
it also contradicts other observations (such as stellar aberration,
which we will not discuss).</p>
<p>A much more elegant solution, dispensing with the idea of the ether
altogether, was presented in 1905 by Albert Einstein: the special theory
of relativity.</p>
