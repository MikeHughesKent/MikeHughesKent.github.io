<h1 class="title">Section 5 - Relativistic Doppler Effect</h1>
<p class="author">Mike Hughes</p>
<p class="date">Physics and Astronomy, University of Kent</p>
</header>
<p>In this lecture we will explore the Doppler effect from a
relativistic perspective and derive an expression for the wavelength
shift of light due to a moving source or observer. This has some
important applications in cosmology, particularly related to the
cosmological red-shift.</p>
<h1 id="non-relativistic-doppler-effect">Non-relativistic Doppler
Effect</h1>
<p>We are familiar with the Doppler effect for sound waves in everyday
experience - it is the effect that causes the pitch of the noise from a
car be higher as it comes towards you, and lower as it moves away.</p>
<p>The explanation for this is intuitively simple when we consider that
sound is a wave, travelling through air. If we are stationary (with
respect to the air), then for sound waves generated by the car moving
towards us the crests of the waves are closer together than they
otherwise would be, and further apart when it is moving away. Closer
wave crests means a higher frequency or pitch. This is illustrated in
Figure <a href="#fig:doppler" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:doppler">1</a>.</p>
<figure id="fig:doppler">
<p><img src="Pictures/doppler.png" style="width:14cm" alt="image" />
<span id="fig:doppler" data-label="fig:doppler"></span></p>
<figcaption>Illustration of Doppler effect for sound.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Similarly, if we were moving through the air towards the car, the
crests of the waves would appear closer together, giving a higher
frequency, while if we were moving away, the waves would be further
apart, giving a lower frequency.</p>
<p>To express this mathematically, consider a source of sound,
generating waves such that a crest is created every <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span> seconds. The waves travel at a
velocity <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>. If the source is moving
towards an observer at velocity <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>,
then it will move a distance <span class="math inline">\(\Delta x = u
\Delta t\)</span> between the creation of each wave crest. So the next
crest will have to travel a distance of <span
class="math inline">\(u\Delta t\)</span> less to reach the observer than
if the source was non-moving. Since wave crests are travelling at <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, this means the next crest will arrive
a time <span class="math inline">\(u\Delta t / v\)</span> earlier than
it otherwise would have.</p>
<p>So, if we call the time difference between each peak as measured by
the observer <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t&#39;\)</span>, then:
<span class="math display">\[\Delta t&#39; = \Delta t -u \Delta t /v =
\Delta t(1-u/v)\]</span></p>
<p>Now if we remember that the frequency of a wave is the inverse of the
period, <span class="math inline">\(f = 1 / \Delta T\)</span>, and we
label the frequency seen by the observer as <span
class="math inline">\(f_{obs} = 1/ \Delta t&#39;\)</span> and the
frequency sent by the source as <span class="math inline">\(f_{source} =
1/ \Delta t\)</span>, then we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\boxed{f_{obs} =
\frac{1}{1-u/v}f_{source}}\]</span> A similar argument shows that, if
the observer is moving towards the source with velocity <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, <span
class="math display">\[\boxed{f_{obs} =
\bigg(1+\frac{u}{v}\bigg)f_{source}}\]</span></p>
<p>These are the equations for the non-relativistic Doppler effect.</p>
<h1 id="relativistic-doppler-effect">Relativistic Doppler Effect</h1>
<p>When dealing with light, we no longer have a medium that the source
and the observer can move relative to. So it can only be the velocity of
the source relative to the observer than can matter.</p>
<p>The correct equation for the relativistic Doppler effect is:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span class="math display">\[f_{obs} =
\sqrt{\frac{1+u/c}{1-u/c}}f_{source}\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is velocity of the source relative to
the observer.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="derivation-of-the-relativistic-doppler-effect">Derivation of the
Relativistic Doppler Effect</h1>
<p>To derive the relativistic Doppler effect equation, we will work in
the reference frame of the observer. The source is therefore moving at
velocity <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>. If we think back to our
equation for the observed time spacing between peaks arriving at the
observer: <span class="math display">\[\Delta t&#39; = \Delta
t(1-u/v)\]</span> then we need to make two changes to accommodate
working with light. The first is that the velocity, <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, is now the velocity of light, <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. The second is that, since the observer
sees the source in motion, we need to allow for time dilation. We
therefore have <span class="math display">\[\Delta t&#39; = \gamma
(1-u/c)\Delta t.\]</span> That’s all the physics we need, so now we
expand out the <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> term to
obtain: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \Delta t&#39; &amp;= \frac{1-u/c}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}}\Delta t \\
    &amp;= \sqrt{\frac{(1-u/c)^2}{(1+u/c)(1-u/c)}} \Delta t \\
    &amp; = \sqrt{\frac{1-u/c}{1+u/c}   }\Delta t .
\end{aligned}\]</span> Frequency is <span class="math inline">\(1/\Delta
t\)</span> and so, we obtain <span class="math display">\[\boxed{f_{obs}
= \sqrt{\frac{1+u/c}{1-u/c}}f_{source}}\]</span> We derived this for the
case that the source was moving towards the observer with velocity <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span>. If the source is moving away, we need
to use <span class="math inline">\(-u\)</span>, so that <span
class="math inline">\(1+u/c\)</span> becomes <span
class="math inline">\(1-u/c\)</span> and vice-versa.</p>
<p>Notice something else critical here. <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is the velocity of the source relative
to the observer. Unlike for sound, where we cared about the velocity of
both the source <em>and</em> the observer relative to the air, with
light we only care about the relative velocity between the source and
the observer. That is to say, we don’t need to derive a second equation
to tell us what happens when the observer is in motion. So in some ways,
the relativistic Doppler Effect is simpler!</p>
<h1 id="relativistic-doppler-effect-in-cosmology">Relativistic Doppler
Effect in Cosmology</h1>
<p>In the cosmology section of this module, you will learn about the
expansion of the universe being measured by the red shift. The idea is
that if we look at wavelength spectra of light coming from stars, we see
that there are lines at wavelengths corresponding to certain atomic
transitions. The wavelengths that these lines should appear at are
well-known from studies here on Earth. When we look at the stars, we
notice that the positions of these lines appear to be shifted in
wavelength. This is due to the relativistic Doppler effect, telling us
that the stars are moving relative to us. (In fact they are almost
always moving away, but that is another discussion).</p>
<div class="example">
<p>As an example, consider measuring the spectrum from star. We know
that there should be a highly characteristic dark line in the spectrum
at a wavelength of 479.8 nm, which is due to the presence of hydrogen
(called the H-alpha line). However, when we observe the star we instead
see the line at 537.4 nm . How fast must the star be moving?</p>
<p>First we need to remember that <span class="math inline">\(\lambda =
c/f\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is
wavelength and <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is frequency. So
if we rewrite the Doppler equation in terms of wavelength, we have:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \lambda_{obs}/c &amp;= \sqrt{\frac{1-u/c}{1+u/c}}\lambda_{source}/c
\\
    \lambda_{obs} &amp;= \sqrt{\frac{1-u/c}{1+u/c}}\lambda_{source}
\end{aligned}\]</span> A bit of algebra gives us: <span
class="math display">\[u/c = \frac{\lambda_{source}^2
-\lambda_{obs}^2}{\lambda_{source}^2 +\lambda_{obs}^2}\]</span> and so
if we can substitute in our known source wavelength (<span
class="math inline">\(\lambda_{source} = 479.8\)</span> nm) and our
wavelength observed here on Earth (<span
class="math inline">\(\lambda_{obs} = 537.4\)</span> nm), we find that
the star is moving with a velocity of <span class="math display">\[u =
-0.11c\]</span></p>
<p>Notice that the observed wavelength was longer than the source
wavelength. Longer wavelengths are toward to the red end of the visible
spectrum, and so we call this red-shift. Red-shifted light implies that
the source is moving away from us. Hence we had a negative value for
<span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> (remember that we derived this
equation for a source moving towards the observer with velocity <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span>). Therefore the star is moving away at
a velocity of <span class="math inline">\(0.11c\)</span>.</p>
