<h1 class="title">Section 4 - Spacetime and the Relativity of
Simultaneity</h1>

</header>
<p>We will now looks at some deeper aspects of special relativity,
studying the breakdown in our ideas of absolute simultaneity. Some
<strong>non-examinable</strong> ideas are also covered, including the
spacetime interval, a quantity which <em>can</em> be considered absolute
in the sense that it does not change under a Lorentz transformation.
This is include here for interest, you will study it in more detail in
later courses.</p>
<h2 id="ladder-paradox">Ladder Paradox</h2>
<p>The ladder "paradox" is a classic situation in special relativity. If
you understand the ladder paradox you are a good way to understanding
the key ideas of the theory.</p>
<p>A farmer is standing next to his shed. He would like to put his
ladder inside the shed, but he has a problem. The shed is 2 m in length
while the ladder is 4 m long. Luckily, he has studied PH304, and he has
an idea. He realises that if he moves the ladder at a velocity of <span
class="math inline">\(\sqrt{3}c/2\)</span>, he will have a gamma factor
of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = 2\)</span>. The ladder will then
be length contracted, in the frame of the farmer and the non-moving
shed, by a factor of 2, making it 2 m in length and just able to fit
inside the shed.</p>
<p>Of course, it won’t be in the shed for very long before it crashes
through the other side. However, in a second stroke of luck, the shed
has two sets of doors, front and back. The ladder will enter the front
door, which he can then quickly close, momentarily trapping the ladder
inside. To prevent any damage to his shed doors, he will then
immediately open the back door, allowing the ladder to pass through and
carry on its way at <span
class="math inline">\(\sqrt{3}c/2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Leaving aside questions of how he accelerates the ladder, or opens
and closes the doors so fast, does this work?</p>
<p>From the rest frame of the shed, it looks like it will indeed work.
The difficulty comes when we consider things from the rest frame of the
ladder (the ladder’s point of view). From this frame it is the shed that
it is moving, and so length contracted by a factor of 2. So now the shed
is only 1 m in length, while the ladder maintains its length of 4 m in
its rest frame. So in the rest frame of the ladder, things are even
worse than they were to start with!</p>
<p>How is this paradox resolved? The answer is that the closing of the
front and back doors of the shed are events separated in space. This
means that while they are simultaneous for the farmer/shed, they are not
simultaneous for the ladder. The ladder will see the back door open
<em>before</em> the front door closes, and so it will never be entirely
within the shed.</p>
<p>There is a problem on Worksheet 2 in which you will work through this
in more detail.</p>
<h2 id="relativity-of-simultaneity">Relativity of Simultaneity</h2>
<p>It is clear from the Lorentz transform for time: <span
class="math display">\[t&#39; = \gamma(t - ux/c^2),\]</span></p>
<p>that time is measured differently for observers moving in different
inertial frames. A consequence of this, which may not be immediately
apparent, is that two events which are separated in space, and which one
observer considers to occur at the same time (i.e. they are
simultaneous), will not be simultaneous in a different inertial frame.
Indeed, in some circumstances it may even be that the two observers do
not even agree on the ordering of the events. It is often the failure to
fully appreciate the breakdown of absolute simultaneity which can leads
to difficulties in our understanding and apparent "paradoxes".</p>
<p>Consider two events occurring, events 1 and 2. They occur at two
positions along the x-axis, <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>, at times <span
class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(t_2\)</span>, as measured by an observer in
reference frame <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. Let’s say that
in reference frame <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> they are
simultaneous, that is <span class="math inline">\(t_1 = t_2\)</span> ,
and let’s call this time <span class="math inline">\(t_1 = t_2 =
0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now consider a second reference frame, <span
class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span> moving at <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span>. From the Lorentz transformations, we
can calculate the times of the events in <span
class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[t_1&#39; =\gamma(t_1 - ux_1/c^2) =
\gamma(-ux_1/c^2)\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[t_2&#39;
=\gamma(t_2 - ux_2/c^2) = \gamma(-ux_2/c^2)\]</span> It’s immediately
obvious that <span class="math inline">\(t&#39;_1 \neq t&#39;_2\)</span>
unless <span class="math inline">\(x_1 = x_2\)</span>. That is to say
that events which are separated in space and are simultaneous in <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> are not simultaneous in <em>any other
frame</em> <span class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span>. We can also see
that the order of <span class="math inline">\(t_1&#39;\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(t_2&#39;\)</span> is not fixed, and depends
on the values of <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="twin-paradox">Twin Paradox</h2>
<p>The twin paradox is less illustrative of the principles of special
relativity, but is nevertheless important for other reasons. It is
illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:twin" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:twin">1</a>.</p>
<p>An astronaut sets out from Earth at a speed <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, which is some appreciable fraction of
the speed of light. She travels for some distance, turns around and
comes back. The question is, will her clock agree with the clock of her
twin sister who has stayed on Earth? Or to put it another way, will they
have aged differently?</p>
<p>From the point of view of the twin on Earth, the astronaut has been
moving, and so time should have been running slower for the astronaut;
while the astronaut measures a time <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> on her clock, the twin at home measures
a time <span class="math inline">\(\gamma t\)</span> on her clock. So
when the astronaut arrives back at Earth, she will have aged less and be
younger than the twin who stayed behind. So far, so good.</p>
<p>But now let’s look at it from the point of view of the astronaut. In
her rest frame, she says that it is actually the Earth that moves away
and then comes back. So from her point of view, everything is reversed,
and she says that it will be the twin who stayed on Earth who will be
the younger.</p>
<figure id="fig:twin">
<img src="pictures/twin.jpg" />
<figcaption>Illustration of the twin paradox, from the point of view of
the Earth (left) and the spaceship pilot (right). From the point of view
of the Earth, the spaceship goes out and comes back. From the point of
view of the spaceship pilot, it is the Earth that moves away and then
turns around and comes back.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Clearly both can’t be correct; when they stand next to each other and
compare their clocks, they cannot both be the slow ones. So what has
happened?</p>
<p>To find the answer we return to the first postulate, which says that
the laws of physics are the same in all <em>inertial</em> frames. But
the astronaut was not in an inertial frame, she would have felt the
acceleration as she left Earth, the deceleration at the mid-way point
and acceleration back towards Earth and then a final deceleration as she
arrived.</p>
<p>In principle we can ignore the accelerations at Earth - we could
always synchronise clocks in a flypast. But there is no way to avoid the
acceleration at the mid-way point. One way of thinking about it is that,
at the time she turned around, the astronaut jumped between two
different inertial frames travelling in opposite directions.</p>
<p>So who is correct? The answer is the twin who stayed on Earth. Since
she stayed in an inertial frame at all times, it is perfectly valid for
her to calculate everything using the Lorentz transformations. For the
astronaut, it is not.</p>
<p>This goes to the heart of the matter of symmetry in special
relativity. Two observers moving relative to each other both say that
the other’s clock is running slow. This is not a paradox, because the
clocks are spatially separated at all times (except for time <span
class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span> for which <span
class="math inline">\(t&#39;=0\)</span> so they both still agree.) In
order to bring the clocks together, so we can look at them side by side,
we require an acceleration, in which case we change the calculation!</p>
<h2 id="aside---spacetime-diagrams-not-examinable">Aside - Spacetime
Diagrams [Not Examinable]</h2>
<p>We can represent objects in space and time by a diagram called a
<strong>spacetime diagram</strong>, shown in Figure <a
href="#fig:spacetime" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:spacetime">2</a>. Since there are three spatial
dimensions (<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>,<span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>,<span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>)
plus time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, a true spacetime
diagram would need to be four dimensional! However, since we are
normally only interested in the position along the axis of motion, which
we label as <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, we can draw useful
spacetime diagrams only involving <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<figure id="fig:spacetime">
<img src="pictures/spacetime.png" style="width:10cm" />
<figcaption>Four examples of spacetime diagrams. Each diagram has <span
class="math inline">\(ct\)</span> on the <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis and <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> on the <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis. The worldline of light is a line
at 45 degrees from the origin. The worldline of a moving object is a
line at a smaller angle than 45 degrees from the <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis. Events are marked as a point in
the diagram. The final figure shows a worldline of light from an event,
in this case travelling at 45 degrees up and to the left, returning to
<span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Individual events can be plotted, and the path an object takes
through a spacetime diagram is called its <strong>worldline</strong>.
Notice a couple of things. Firstly, we plot <span
class="math inline">\(ct\)</span> rather than <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. This is so that the worldline of light
is at 45 degrees. Secondly, <span class="math inline">\(ct\)</span> is
plotted on the y-axis and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> on the
x-axis. This may be slightly counter-intuitive, as we are used to
thinking of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> as the independent
variable going on the x-axis, but it quickly becomes natural with
practice. Try to think of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(ct\)</span> as just two different
co-ordinates in spacetime.</p>
<h2 id="aside---spacetime-interval---an-invariant-not-examinable">Aside
- Spacetime interval - an invariant [Not Examinable]</h2>
<p>We speak about a quantity being <strong>Lorentz Invariant</strong> if
it does not change <em>when we switch between reference frames</em>.
Note that this is a very different concept from a conserved quantity
(such as momentum) which doesn’t change <em>in time</em>.</p>
<p>Clearly <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> are not Lorentz invariant, since the
Lorentz transformations tell us that they change between reference
frames. But we can ask whether there is some other invariant quantity
which is a combination of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<p>An analogy which may be useful is to think of the points on a
circumference of a circle. As we move around the circle, which we can
think of as a rotation, our x and y co-ordinates change. However, the
radius of the circle (our distance from the centre) is invariant, given
simply by <span class="math inline">\(r^2 = x^2 + y^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>There is something similar we can calculate for space and time under
Lorentz transformations. While space and time (<span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>) change, there is a value that we can
calculate which is invariant. This invariant is called the
<strong>spacetime interval</strong> or <strong>spacetime
distance</strong> and is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(\Delta s)^2 = (\Delta x)^2 - (c\Delta
t)^2\]</span></p>
<p>This looks a little similar to our circle invariant, although with
some obvious differences. In particular, we notice that it is <span
class="math inline">\(- (c\Delta t)^2\)</span> and not <span
class="math inline">\(+(c\Delta t)^2\)</span>. This means that the
spacetime interval can be negative or positive, depending on whether
<span class="math inline">\((c\Delta t)^2\)</span> is smaller or bigger
than <span class="math inline">\((\Delta x)^2\)</span>. By analogy to
the circle we can think of a Lorentz transformation being something like
a rotation in spacetime, with the proviso that the geometry of spacetime
is a little different from the Euclidean geometry we are used to.</p>
<p>Whether the right-hand-side is positive or negative (or 0) has a very
important physical meaning. First lets consider the very special case of
<span class="math inline">\((\Delta s)^2\)</span> = 0. This means that
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
(\Delta x)^2 &amp;= (c \Delta t)^2
\\\Delta x&amp;=c \Delta t
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>If the distance travelled is <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>
times the time, then the velocity is obviously <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. We call this
<strong><em>lightlike</em></strong> or <em>‘null’</em>.</p>
<p>If two events are separated by <span class="math inline">\((\Delta
s)^2 &gt; 0\)</span> then this means than the distance between them is
larger than <span class="math inline">\(c \Delta t\)</span>. We call
this a <strong><em>spacelike</em></strong> interval. It means that there
is some reference frame where the two events are simultaneous, in which
case they will be separated by a distance of <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta d\)</span> (but only in that special
reference frame). There can be no causal link between the two events,
because even a signal travelling at the speed of light couldn’t have
covered the distance in time. Therefore a change in the order of the
events does not violate causality - there can be no mixing of cause and
effect.</p>
<p>If two events are separated by <span class="math inline">\((\Delta
s)^2 &lt; 0\)</span> then we call this interval
<strong><em>timelike</em></strong>. There is no reference frame where
these two events are simultaneous, but there is a reference frame where
they occur at the same place at different times, with a time difference
of <span class="math inline">\(t=\sqrt{-\Delta s^2)}/c\)</span>. All
observers must agree on the order in which the two events occurred. This
is critical because, if two events are timelike separated, then there
could have been a causal link between them, and no-one can observe an
effect happening before its cause!</p>
<h2 id="aside---intervals-on-spacetime-diagrams-not-examinable">Aside -
Intervals on Spacetime Diagrams [Not examinable]</h2>
<p>A nice way to visualise spacelike and timelike spacetime distance is
using our spacetime diagrams. If we place an observer at the origin and
draw lines for <span class="math inline">\(x=ct\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x=-ct\)</span> we obtain what are known as
‘light-cones’, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:lightcone"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:lightcone">3</a>. For
positive times this is the ‘future light cone’ and for negative times it
is the ‘past light cone’. Only events in your past light cone can
influence you now, and you can only influence events in your future
light cone. Signals from events which are outside your past light cone
(events which are <em>spacelike separated</em> from you) cannot possibly
have reached you yet, and you cannot possibly send a signal to events
outside your future light cone.</p>
<figure id="fig:lightcone">
<img src="pictures/lightcone.png" style="width:8cm" />
<figcaption>Past and future lightcones illustrated on spacetime diagram.
The apex of each cone is at the origin, with the past and future light
cones lying between 45 degree lines emanating from the origin. Events
that are timelike separated from the origin are inside the light-cone
while events that are spacelike separated are outside the
light-cone.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Note that the spacetime interval will not be on the exam (although
you may find it in past papers) - This is now covered, along with other
invariants, as part of the Stage 2 relativity course.</p>
