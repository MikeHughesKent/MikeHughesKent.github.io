<h1 class="title">Introduction to Waves</h1>

</header>
<p>Waves are an important phenomenon in physics, and one that you will
encounter many times in your studies. Waves transport energy (and
momentum) without transporting matter. Some waves travel through media
(such as air) while others (such as electromagnetic waves) can travel
through a vacuum. In the this section we will define some basic wave
concepts and understand the idea of the wave equation, a differential
equation describing wave motion.</p>
<h2 id="wave-motion">Wave Motion</h2>
<p>We start by considering a pulse travelling along a slinky string. We
can generate this by oscillating one end of the slinky string. The wave
pulse moves along the string, perpendicular to the driving oscillation.
We refer to this as a <strong>transverse wave</strong>.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s label the axis along the slinky as <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and the axis on which we drive the
oscillation as <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. We can then
describe the displacement of any point along the slinky at some point in
time by some function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> such
that displacement, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, is given by
<span class="math inline">\(y = f(x)\)</span>.</p>
<figure id="fig:trav_wave">
<img src="pictures/trav_wave.png" style="width:10cm" />
<figcaption>Illustration of a travelling wave at two points in
time.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If we have a wave motion then this pattern of displacement is moving
along the slinky to the right with some speed <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span>. At time <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> the wave is then described by <span
class="math display">\[y = f(x - vt).\]</span></p>
<p>We can understand this by using the ideas of frames of reference
introduced in special relativity. If we consider a frame of reference
<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> attached to the crest of the
wave, which has the form <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>
moving with speed <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> along the
x-axis, then we can use the Galilean transformation <span
class="math inline">\(x&#39; = x-vt\)</span> to immediately see that the
wave appears to be <span class="math inline">\(f(x-vt)\)</span> in a
frame of reference where the wave is moving at speed <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span>. Check that you intuitively understand
why this has a <span class="math inline">\(-vt\)</span> and not a <span
class="math inline">\(+vt\)</span> when the wave is moving along the
positive <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-direction.</p>
<h2 id="transverse-and-longitudinal-waves">Transverse and Longitudinal
Waves</h2>
<p>The type of wave we discussed on the slinky spring is a
<strong>transverse wave</strong> - the oscillation is perpendicular to
the direction of wave propagation. The alternative is a
<strong>longitudinal wave</strong>, in which the oscillation and the
wave motion are along the same axis. Sound is a longitudinal wave, the
air molecules oscillate to form compressions and expansions along the
direction the wave is travelling. Light is a transverse wave,
oscillations in the electric/magnetic fields are in the perpendicular
direction - more on this later.</p>
<h2 id="the-wave-equation">The Wave Equation</h2>
<p>The wave equation is a general equation which has a huge range of
applications across physics.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} =
\frac{1}{v^2} \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>This is a second order partial differential equation in both space
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and time <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Strictly this is the 1D wave equation,
since it has no dependence on the two other spatial co-ordinates, and we
can write a similar equation in 3D. The exact meaning of <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> depends on the specifics of the
wave.</p>
<p>An important property of the wave equation is that it is satisfied by
any function of the form <span class="math inline">\(f(x) =
x-vt\)</span> (i.e. a travelling wave). We can verify this as
follows.</p>
<p>Take some function <span class="math inline">\(y = f(x-vt)\)</span>.
To simplify the maths, we will write <span class="math inline">\(\alpha
= x-vt\)</span>; note that <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>
is therefore a function of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, i.e. it is a function of the
things we want to take the derivative with respect to.</p>
<p>We can then compute the LHS of the wave equation. Begin with taking
just the first order derivative, <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial y}{\partial \alpha}
\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial y}{\partial \alpha},
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>where in the first step we have used the chain rule, and in the
second step we have used that <span
class="math display">\[\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial x} =
\frac{\partial (x - vt)}{\partial x} = 1.\]</span></p>
<p>Now we can repeat the procedure to obtain the second derivative (i.e.
the LHS of the wave equation), <span
class="math display">\[\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} =
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \frac{\partial y}{\partial \alpha} =
\frac{\partial (\partial y/ \partial \alpha)}{\partial \alpha}
\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial
\alpha^2},\]</span></p>
<p>where again we used the chain rule and then that <span
class="math inline">\(\partial \alpha / \partial x = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now we do the same for the RHS side, <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial y}{\partial \alpha}
\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial t} = -v\frac{\partial y}{\partial
\alpha},
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>where this time we used <span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial
\alpha}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial (x - vt)}{\partial t} =
-v.\]</span></p>
<p>The second derivative is then <span
class="math display">\[\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} =
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \bigg( -v \frac{\partial y}{\partial \alpha}
\bigg) = (-v) \frac{\partial (\partial y/ \partial \alpha)}{\partial
\alpha} \frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial x} = (-v) (-v)\frac{\partial^2
y}{\partial \alpha^2} = v^2\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial
\alpha^2}.\]</span></p>
<p>We can now see that this does indeed satisfy the wave equation, i.e.
<span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} =
\frac{1}{v^2} \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} \rightarrow
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial \alpha^2} = \frac{1}{v^2}
v^2\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial \alpha^2}\]</span></p>
<h2 id="derivation-of-the-wave-equation">Derivation of the Wave
Equation</h2>
<p>There is no single derivation for the wave equation as the same
equation arises from many different physical systems. The example below
is for a stretched string.</p>
<p>Consider an arbitrarily small segment of a stretched string under
tension as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:string"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:string">2</a>.</p>
<figure id="fig:string">
<img src="pictures/string.png" style="width:10cm" />
<figcaption>Stretched string for derivation of wave
equation.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For a string under tension there must be equal and opposite forces
acting on each segment along the string. The horizontal forces balance,
i.e. <span class="math display">\[F_{1,x} = -F_{2,x}\]</span></p>
<p>and so the total horizontal force, <span class="math inline">\(F_x =
0\)</span> and we no longer need to consider these.</p>
<p>We are now going to pluck the string so that we are disturbing it
entirely in the vertical (<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>)
direction. The vertical force due to the tension in the string can be
written <span class="math display">\[F_y = F_{1,y} + F_{2,y} = F_T\sin
\theta_1 - F_T \sin \theta_2\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(F_T\)</span> is the tension in the
string. It is difficult to work with <span class="math inline">\(\sin
\theta\)</span> because this is a ratio over the hypotenuse which is the
length of the segment. However, if <span class="math inline">\(\theta
\ll 1\)</span> we can approximate that <span class="math inline">\(\sin
\theta \approx \tan \theta\)</span>. This is more useful because <span
class="math inline">\(\tan \theta\)</span> is the ratio <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta x / \Delta y\)</span>. We will write <span
class="math inline">\(S = \Delta x / \Delta y\)</span> so that we have
the total vertical force <span class="math display">\[F_y = F_{1,y} +
F_{2,y} \approx F_T\tan \theta_1 - F_T \tan \theta_2 = F_T (S_2 - S_1) =
F_T \Delta S.\]</span></p>
<p>Now we use Newtons law, <span class="math inline">\(F = ma\)</span>,
realising that the vertical acceleration can be written <span
class="math display">\[a_y = \frac{\partial^2y}{\partial t^2}.\]</span>
The mass of the segment of string can be written as <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta m \approx \mu \Delta x\)</span>, where
<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is the mass per unit length of
the string. Then, considering the vertical force, we have <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    F_y  &amp;= ma_y \\
    F_T \Delta S &amp;= \mu \Delta x  \frac{\partial^2y}{\partial t^2}
\\
    F_T \frac{\Delta S}{\Delta x} &amp;=
\mu  \frac{\partial^2y}{\partial t^2}.
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Finally, we take the limit where the segment becomes infinitesimal,
i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\Delta x\to 0\)</span>, <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \lim_{\Delta x \to 0}  F_T \frac{\Delta S}{\Delta x}
&amp;=  \mu  \frac{\partial^2y}{\partial t^2} \\
    F_T \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \frac {\partial y}{\partial x}
&amp;=  \mu  \frac{\partial^2y}{\partial t^2} \\
    \frac {\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} &amp;=   \frac{\mu}{F_T}
\frac{\partial^2y}{\partial t^2}.
\end{aligned}\]</span> We have therefore obtained a wave equation. This
immediately tells us that plucking the string will generate a wave which
moves <em>along</em> the string. We can read off of the speed of the
wave by comparing with the general wave equation, and seeing that <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \frac{1}{v^2} = \frac{\mu}{F_T} \\
    v = \sqrt{\frac{F_T}{\mu}}.
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<h2 id="harmonic-waves">Harmonic Waves</h2>
<p>To understand a system we then want to find solutions to the wave
equation that gives displacement <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>
as a function of position, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, and
time, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. There are a large number
of solutions, but one of the most general useful ways to write solutions
is as an <strong>harmonic wave</strong>, where each point on the string
oscillates with simple harmonic motion.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span class="math display">\[y = A \cos(kx - \omega t +
\delta),\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>We could also write <span class="math inline">\(y = A \sin(kx -
\omega t + \delta)\)</span>, the only difference being that we need to
adjust <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> by adding <span
class="math inline">\(\pi / 2\)</span> to get the wave to be exactly the
same place on the x-axis. It is perfectly acceptable to use either.</p>
<p>We have introduced four quantities by which the harmonic wave
solution is parameterised: <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is simply the amplitude of
the wave.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is called the wavenumber,
it controls how quickly the wave oscillates along the spatial
direction.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> is called the angular
frequency, it controls how quickly the wave oscillates in time.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> is called the phase
offset, this controls the starting point of the wave (i.e. the wave when
<span class="math inline">\(x= t=0\)</span>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As an exercise you can check that this is indeed a solution. Notice
that harmonic waves are <strong>periodic waves</strong> - i.e. they
repeat after some interval.</p>
<p>The argument of the cosine/sine, i.e. everything inside the brackets,
the <span class="math inline">\((kx - \omega t + \delta)\)</span>, is
called the <strong>phase</strong>. You may sometimes see waves written
in the <strong>phasor form</strong>, <span class="math display">\[y =
\Re{\exp(i[kx - \omega t + \delta])},\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\Re\)</span> means to take the real
part of a complex number. If you remember Eulerâ€™s identity, <span
class="math display">\[\exp(ix) = \cos(x) + i\sin(x),\]</span></p>
<p>then you will see that these are the same thing, i.e. <span
class="math inline">\(\Re{\exp(ix)} = \cos(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Aside:</strong> Quite often this written without the <span
class="math inline">\(\Re\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(y =
\exp(ix)\)</span>. This doesnâ€™t mean the wave is complex, you need to
remember to take the real part at the end of any calculations you do.
The reason we do this is that itâ€™s mathematically simpler to work with
exponential than sines - you donâ€™t have to remember all the trig
identifies. We wonâ€™t use the phasor representation in this part of the
course, but it will come up later in your studies.</p>
<h2 id="visualising-haromonic-waves">Visualising Haromonic Waves</h2>
<p>To visualise harmonic waves it is convenient to fix one of the
variables, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, or <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. If we fix <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> then we are looking at a single point
in time, if we fix <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> then we are
looking at all the points at a fixed time.</p>
<figure id="fig:waves">
<img src="pictures/wave.png" style="width:12cm" />
<figcaption>A harmonic wave, viewed at a single point in space (left)
and a single point in time (right)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We define the wavelength, <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, of the wave as the distance
between to identical points (e.g. two peaks) when we have frozen the
time variable. This is related to the wavenumber, <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, by <span
class="math display">\[\lambda = \frac{2\pi}{k}.\]</span></p>
<p>Similarly, the period, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, is the
time difference between two peaks when we are looking at a single
spatial position, and is related to the angular frequency, <span
class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>, by <span class="math display">\[T
= \frac{2\pi}{\omega}.\]</span></p>
<h2 id="speed-of-harmonic-waves">Speed of Harmonic Waves</h2>
<p>By substituting the expression for an harmonic wave into the wave
equation, we can read off that <span class="math inline">\(v = \omega /
k\)</span>, or equivalently, <span class="math inline">\(v =
f\lambda\)</span>. Another way to see this is to consider a point on the
wave moving at speed <span class="math inline">\(v = \partial x /
\partial t\)</span>. Since we are considering a fixed point, the phase,
<span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>, does not change with time,
i.e., <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} &amp;= 0 \\
    \frac{\partial (kx - \omega t)} {\partial t} &amp; = 0 \\
    k\frac{\partial x}{\partial t} - \omega &amp; = 0 \\
    v = \frac{\omega}{k}
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span class="math display">\[v = \frac{\omega}{k} =
f\lambda\]</span></p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p><em>A wave is described by the following equation: <span
class="math display">\[y = (20~\mathrm{m})\sin( [40~\mathrm{m^{-1}}]x -
[12~\mathrm{s^{-1}}t])\]</span> What is its amplitude, wavelength,
period and velocity?</em></p>
<p><br />
<strong>SOLUTION:</strong><br />
By inspection the amplitude is 20Â m.<br />
By inspection <span class="math inline">\(k =
40~\mathrm{m^{-1}}\)</span> and so <span class="math display">\[\lambda
= \frac{2\pi}{k} = \frac{2\pi}{40~\mathrm{m^{-1}}} =
0.157~\mathrm{m}\]</span> By inspection <span
class="math inline">\(\omega = 12~\mathrm{rad~s^{-1}}\)</span> and so
<span class="math display">\[T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} =
\frac{2\pi~\mathrm{rad}}{12~\mathrm{rad~s^{-1}}} =
0.523~\mathrm{s}\]</span> Velocity is given by: <span
class="math display">\[v = \frac{\omega}{k} =
\frac{12~\mathrm{rad~s^{-1}}} {40~\mathrm{m^{-1}}} =
0.3~\mathrm{m/s}\]</span></p>
</div>
<h2 id="doppler-effect">Doppler Effect</h2>
<p>The Doppler effect is the change in frequency of a wave when the
source and or receiver are moving relative to each other. The origin and
derivation of this is covered in the Special Relativity notes from
PHYS3210. The Doppler effect is described by the following equation:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span class="math display">\[f_r = f_0\frac{v \pm v_r}{v \pm v_s
}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span> is the
frequency generated by the source, <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is the speed of the wave. <span
class="math inline">\(v_r\)</span> is the speed of the receiver and
<span class="math inline">\(v_s\)</span> is the speed of the source.</p>
<p>Choosing whether the <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span>s
becomes a <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span> or a <span
class="math inline">\(-\)</span> is difficult to remember. The rule is
that if the receiver is moving away from the source then the numerator
should have a minus, and if the source if moving away from the receiver
then the denominator should have a plus (and vice-versa). The easiest
way to remember is that we want to get a higher frequency if they are
moving towards each other and a lower frequency if they are moving away,
so always choose the version of the equation that makes physical
sense.</p>
</div>
<p>Note that the speeds are defined relative to the medium that the wave
is travelling in. So, for example, if we are dealing with sound then
this is usually going to be the air. The equation is only valid when the
speeds of the objects are much less than the speed of the wave, i.e.
<span class="math inline">\(v_r, v_s \ll v\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>(Note that the Doppler equation is different for light due to
relativistic effects, this was covered in PHYS3210 and will not be
examined in PHYS3220).</em></p>
<div class="example">
<p>Object A is stationery and generates sound at 1000Â Hz. Object B is
moving away from Object A at 20Â m/s. At what frequency does Object B
hear the sound?</p>
<p>In this case the source is stationery, i.e. <span
class="math inline">\(v_s = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>The receiver is moving at <span class="math inline">\(v_r =
20~\mathrm{m/s}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s take the speed of sound in air to be 321Â m/s.</p>
<p>Therefore: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    f_r &amp;= f_0\frac{v \pm v_r}{v \pm v_s } \\
    &amp;= (1000~\mathrm{Hz})\frac{321 - 20}{321} \\
    &amp;= 938~\mathrm{Hz}
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Note we used a <span class="math inline">\(-\)</span> in the
numerator because the objects are moving apart. This gives us the
expected result that the sound is received at a lower frequency than it
was sent.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="linearity-of-the-wave-equation">Linearity of the Wave
Equation</h2>
<p>The wave equation is linear, i.e. it has no powers of <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, or <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> higher than 1. A consequence of this is
that if we have two solutions to the wave equation, <span
class="math inline">\(\phi_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\phi_2\)</span>, then we can make a third solution
by adding these together, <span class="math inline">\(\phi_3 = \phi_1 +
\phi_2\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Aside:</strong> Later in your studies you will encounter
Fourier theory which says that any function can be written as a sum of
sin and cosine terms. This means that any arbitrary wave can be written
as a sum of harmonic waves.</p>
<h2 id="wave-intensity">Wave Intensity</h2>
<p>Imagine a source of waves, emitting in all direction. We can imagine
the leading edge of the wave expanding out from the source as a sphere
of increasing radius. At an instant in time, the power emitted by the
source is therefore distributed over the surface of the sphere. We
define the intensity, <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, as power,
<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, over area, <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span class="math display">\[I = \frac{P}{A} = \frac{P}{4\pi
r^2}\]</span> where we have used that the surface area of a sphere of
radius <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(4 \pi r^2\)</span>. Notice that this is an inverse
square law.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="diffraction-interference-and-standing-waves">Diffraction,
Interference and Standing Waves</h1>
<p>In this section we will briefly introduce ideas of reflection and
interference, topics which you will study in much more detail later on.
We will then look at how they combine to leads to the phenomena of
standing waves. Finally we will briefly introduce diffraction.</p>
<h2 id="superposition-and-interference">Superposition and
Interference</h2>
<p>When two waves meet in space, we say they are â€˜superimposedâ€™. The
resulting disturbance is simply the sum of the disturbance caused by the
two waves. This is known as <strong>superposition.</strong> This
linearity make the analysis of waves relatively straightforward. It is a
consequence of the the linearity of the wave equation, i.e. there are no
powers of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> greater than 1. Not all
waves work in this way, for example oceans surface waves are non-linear
(leading to all kinds of interesting effects), and in certain media
light waves or not linear (giving rise to the field of non-linear
optics).</p>
<p>We refer to superposition as <strong>interference</strong> when the
superposition results in a patterns of high and low intensity, e.g.
bright and dark for light, loud and quiet for sound. (There is no clear
physical difference between superposition and interference, it is more a
matter of terminology). Interference can be observed most easily by
super-imposing two harmonic waves of the same wavelength and frequency.
We also use the terms <strong>constructive</strong> and
<strong>destructive</strong> interference to refer to when the
interference results in a larger or smaller amplitude, respectively.</p>
<figure id="fig:super">
<img src="pictures/superposition.png" style="width:10cm" />
<figcaption>Examples of superposition of two waves with different
relative phase shifts.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In order to see an interference pattern between two waves of the same
frequency, we need some variation in the path length, and hence the
phase, so that we alternate between constructive and destructive
interference. A simple way to obtain this is to have two point sources,
as show in FigureÂ <a href="#fig:interfere" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:interfere">11.2</a>. At each point along the screen
the difference between the two path lengths from the two points sources
is different, i.e. there is a different value of <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in the phasor. We therefore have
different phase shifts and hence different degrees of destructive and
constructive interference at different points along the screen.</p>
<figure id="fig:interfere">
<img src="pictures/interference_pattern.png" style="width:6cm" />
<figcaption>Demonstration of how an interference pattern is created from
two points sources due to different path lengths at each point along
screen,.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="beats">Beats</h2>
<p>Beating occurs when we have super-position of two waves with similar,
but slightly different, frequencies. The results in a third wave of
lower frequency. Qualitatively, it can be explained by considering that
that a single point in space, the two waves will gradually shift in and
out of phase, and so between constructive and destructive interference.
This creates a low frequency wave, with the beat frequency given simply
by the different in frequencies.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span class="math display">\[f = \Delta F\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is the beat frequency and <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta F\)</span> is the difference in frequency
between to the two original waves.</p>
</div>
<p>A full derivation of the beat frequency is provided in Tipler Section
16-1.</p>
<p>We can therefore us the beat frequency to determine, trivially, the
difference in frequency between to the two waves. This is one way to
tune an instrument using a tuning fork. We play a note and then ring the
tuning fork. The instrument is then tuned by adjusting until the beat
frequency becomes very small.</p>
<h3 id="coherence---non-examinable">Coherence - Non-examinable</h3>
<p>We might wonder why we donâ€™t see interference patterns everywhere,
after all light is wave so why donâ€™t we see interference between two
light from two different light bulbs? The answer lies in a concept
called â€˜coherenceâ€™. Light from a light bulb can be though of as being
made up of many different waves, each with a different phase. The phase
of each waves also varies randomly over time. This makes a light bulb an
â€˜incoherent sourceâ€™. We donâ€™t see interference patterns patterns because
the interference pattern changes so rapidly in space and time that it is
averaged out to a uniform intensity. An example of a coherent source is
a laser - and we can create interference using a laser beam. Itâ€™s also
possible to make partially coherent light from incoherent light by
passing it through a very small pinhole. This is how interference
experiments (such as Youngâ€™s slit experiment or the Michelson-Morley
experiment) were able to be conducted long before lasers were invented.
You will learn much more about interference conditions and coherence
later in your studies.</p>
<h2 id="reflection-and-transmission-of-waves">Reflection and
transmission of waves</h2>
<p>When a wave strikes a boundary between two regions where the wave
would travel at difference speeds, some portion of the wave is
reflected. The returning wave is inverted if the second medium has a
lower wave speed. For sounds waves in air, different speeds are caused
by different densities (e.g. sounds travels faster in solids than in
air). We could also imaging a light string attached to a heavier string.
Since a wave on a string has a lower speed in a heavier string, a wave
on the light string would be partially reflected and inverted at the
boundary.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>The fraction of the wave reflected is given by the reflection
coefficient, <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, <span
class="math display">\[r = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{v_2 + v_1},\]</span> where
<span class="math inline">\(v_1\)</span> is the speed in the first
medium and <span class="math inline">\(v_2\)</span> is the speed in the
second medium. The sign of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>
encodes the inversion, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> will
be negative if <span class="math inline">\(v_1 &gt; v_2\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>If we were to take a single string and fix it at one end, we can
consider this as being like a wave passing onto a more massive string,
in the limit that the speed in the second string becomes zero. And so we
have, <span class="math display">\[r = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{v_2 + v_1} =
\frac{0 - v_1}{0 + v_1} = -1,\]</span> meaning that the whole of the
wave is reflected with an inversion.</p>
<p>The fraction of the wave transmitted is simply <span
class="math inline">\(t = 1-r\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[t =
1- \frac{v_2 - v_1}{v_2 + v_1} = \frac{v_2 + v_1 + v_2 - v_1}{v_2 + v_1}
= \frac{2v_2}{v_2 + v_1}.\]</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p>The fraction of the wave transmitted is given by the transmission
coefficient, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, <span
class="math display">\[t = \frac{2v_2}{v_2 + v_1},\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Notice that we always have <span class="math inline">\(t &gt;
1\)</span>, i.e. the transmitted wave is never inverted.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><em>Two wires of different thickness are joined at one end at then
put under tension. The speed of waves in one of the wires (Wire 1) is
<span class="math inline">\(60~\mathrm{m/s}\)</span> and in the other
wire (Wire 2) it is <span
class="math inline">\(90~\mathrm{m/s}\)</span>. A wave is sent along
Wire 1. What fraction of the wave amplitude will be reflected at the
point where the two wires are joined? Will the wave be
inverted?</em></p>
<p>The fraction reflected is given by: <span class="math display">\[r =
\frac{v_2 - v_1}{v_2 + v_1},\]</span> Putting in the speeds gives us:
<span class="math display">\[r = \frac{60 - 90}{60 + 90} = -0.2\]</span>
Therefore 1/5th of the wave will be reflected, and since the coefficient
was found to be negative, the reflected wave will be inverted.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="standing-waves">Standing Waves</h2>
<p>A standing wave is created when we confine a wave in such a way that
it interferes with its own reflection. For example, if we anchor a
string at either end, a wave travelling along the string will reflect
from the anchor point and return back along the string. In certain
circumstances, the interference results in a fixed pattern, known as a
standing wave. This requires that the frequency of the wave is one of
several â€˜modesâ€™ of the particular system we have. These frequencies are
called the <strong>resonant frequencies</strong> and the accompanying
wavefunction is called a <strong>mode of vibration</strong>. The lowest
resonant frequency is called the <strong>fundamental frequency</strong>
and the higher resonant frequencies are called
<strong>overtones</strong>.</p>
<p>Some example of standing waves on a string are shown in the figure
below. We can identify points at which the amplitude is always zero -
these are called <strong>nodes</strong>, labelled N in the figure. The
points mid-way between the nodes, where the amplitude is at a maximum,
are called <strong>anti-nodes</strong>, labelled AN.</p>
<figure id="fig:standing">
<img src="pictures/standing.png" style="width:14cm" />
<figcaption>Examples of standing waves on a string where both ends are
fixed (left) and one end is fixed (right). N is a node, AN is an
antinode.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can predict the harmonic frequencies from the speed of the wave
and the length of the string. First consider a vibrating string of
length <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> where both ends are fixed
(such as a guitar string). It must be that each end of the string is a
node (i.e. amplitude is zero at all times). The lowest frequency of
harmonic wave satisfying this would be the case where there is one
half-wave along the full-length of the string, i.e., <span
class="math display">\[\lambda = 2L.\]</span> The next lowest frequency
would have <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = L\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda = 2L/3\)</span> and so on. In general,
<span class="math display">\[\lambda_n = \frac{2L}{n},\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is a positive integer.
Using <span class="math inline">\(f = v / \lambda\)</span>, the resonant
frequencies are therefore <span class="math display">\[f_n =
n\frac{v}{2n}.\]</span></p>
<p>For the case where one end of the string is free, then we have a node
at one end and an anti-node at the other. We therefore require
wavelengths of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = L/ 4\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(\lambda = 3L / 4\)</span> and so on. The
resonant frequencies therefore occur at <span class="math display">\[f_n
= n\frac{v}{4L}.\]</span> for odd values of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(n =
1,3,5...\)</span></p>
<h2 id="diffraction">Diffraction</h2>
<p>Diffraction is a phenomenon that occurs when a wave is partially
blocked by an obstacle. It is a phenomenon that is unique to waves,
distinguishing them from classical particles. It is a consequence of
interference, but the details are covered in later modules. It can
loosely be described as â€˜bendingâ€™ of the wave which occurs near the edge
of the obstruction. By â€˜nearâ€™ we mean within a few wavelengths. When
waves pass through gaps that are similar in size to their wavelength,
essentially all of the wavefront is close to the edge, and the
diffraction effects are very obvious. However, for gaps which are much
larger than the wavelength, diffraction effects are small. Sound has
wavelengths of metres, and so sounds readily diffracts around everyday
objects. It is diffraction as well as reflection, which allows us to
hear around corner. In contrast light has a wavelength of around 0.5
micrometers and so diffraction effects are not easily observed - the
geometrical approximation that light travels in straight lines is
generally a good ones.</p>
