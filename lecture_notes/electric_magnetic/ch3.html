<h1 class="title">Section 3 - Electric Potential</h1>
<p class="author">Mike Hughes</p>
<p class="date">Physics and Astronomy, University of Kent</p>
</header>
<p>Now that we have defined the electric field it once again seems we
should be finished. However, it is useful to define something called the
electric potential. Note that the electric potential is not the same
thing as electric potential energy, although the two are closely
related. We will discuss electric potential energy first.</p>
<h1 id="electric-potential-energy">Electric Potential Energy</h1>
<p>Consider a positive charge, <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>
which is generating an electric field. We have another positive charge,
which we call the test charge, <span class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span>,
which is very far away. We now bring the test charge towards <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span>.</p>
<p>The two charges will repel each other, so this requires effort and we
have to do work. The electrical potential energy therefore increases,
just like how the gravitational potential energy increases if we push
something up a hill. If we let go of the charges, they will fly apart,
and this electric potential energy becomes kinetic energy, and the
electrostatic force is doing work. Of course, the total energy is always
conserved.</p>
<p>Now, the interesting question is, if we move a test charge in an
electric field from point A to point B, does the change in electric
potential energy depend on the path we take from A to B? That is to say,
does the amount of work needed to move a charge between two points
depend on the route we take?</p>
<p>The answer, in electrostatics, is no. Regardless of whatever winding
route we take from A to B, the amount of work is the same, and hence the
change in electric potential energy will be the same. This means that
the electrostatic force is a conservative force, and the electric field
is a conservative field. Gravitational force is another example of a
conservative force. An example of a non-conservative force is friction -
the energy lost to friction does depend on the path. This means we can
uniquely define the electrostatic energy that <span
class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span> has just based on its position in
space.</p>
<h1 id="electric-potential-energy-due-to-a-point-charge">Electric
Potential Energy due to a Point Charge</h1>
<p>If we have a fixed charge, <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>,
and we bring in a charge <span class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span> from
infinity to a distance of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, then
the total electric potential energy of the system is given by:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span class="math display">\[U = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0}
\frac{qq_0}{|r|} = k \frac{qq_0}{|r|}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Several things to note:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Electric potential energy is a scaler - it has no direction.
<em>While this make the maths far easier, it is also a big source of
confusion!</em></p></li>
<li><p>Electric potential energy falls off as <span
class="math inline">\(1/|r|\)</span> not <span
class="math inline">\(1/r^2\)</span>. <em>Also a source of
confusion.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Electric potential energy has SI units of Joules, J.</p></li>
<li><p>Electric potential energy can be positive or negative. If the two
charges are of opposite sign, then it will be negative. This is because
opposite charges are attracted to each other. So the most possible
electric potential energy is when they are infinitely far apart, and as
the test charge approaches it loses potential energy.</p></li>
<li><p>Just like gravitational potential energy, the absolute value of
electrical potential energy doesn’t mean anything physically, it is only
the change in the electric potential energy which matters. So we are
free to add a constant without changing anything. This also means that
we are free to define the point at which there is zero potential energy
anywhere we like.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1
id="derivation-of-electric-potential-energy-from-a-point-charge">Derivation
of Electric Potential Energy from a Point Charge</h1>
<p>Consider a charge, <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, which is
generating an electric field, and a second test charge, <span
class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span> which we will move. If an
infinitesimal force <span class="math inline">\(d\vec{F_W}\)</span> is
applied to move <span class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span> an
infinitesimal distance <span class="math inline">\(d \vec{dl}\)</span>,
then the work done is <span class="math display">\[dW =
d\vec{F_W}.d\vec{l}\]</span></p>
<p>In moving <span class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span> from point A to
point B, the work done is given by: <span class="math display">\[W =
\int_A^B\vec{F_W}.d\vec{l}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\vec{F}\)</span> is the force
applied. In order to move the charge without giving it a resultant
velocity, the force applied would need to be equal and opposite to the
electrostatic force, <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, i.e. <span
class="math display">\[\Delta U = - \int_A^B
\vec{F}.d\vec{l}\]</span></p>
<p>This tells us the difference in potential energy between two points.
It is only ever really the difference in energy we care about, that is
the only thing that has a physical meaning. If we want to specify the
absolute potential energy, rather than a difference, we need to choose
some reference point at which we will say the electric potential energy
is zero (just like how me might choose the surface of the Earth as the
point with zero gravitational potential energy). We are free to choose
this wherever we like. By convention we choose this point as a point
which is infinitely far away from the charge <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span>. This turns out to be convenient
because infinitely far away from a charge, the force and the electric
field from that charge goes to zero.</p>
<p>The force, <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, at a distance
<span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is given by Coulomb’s Law <span
class="math display">\[\vec{F} = \frac{kqq_0}{r^2} \hat{r}\]</span></p>
<p>and so to find out the potential energy for <span
class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span> at a distance <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> from this charge, we need to imagine
bringing in <span class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span> from infinity (i.e.
we calculate the difference in energy from this point with infinity). So
we need to integrate from <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span> to
<span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[U =
- \int_{\infty}^r \vec{F}.d\vec{l} = - \int_{\infty}^r\frac{kqq_0}{r^2}
\hat{r}.d\vec{l}\]</span></p>
<p>Now, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{r}.d\vec{l}\)</span> (a dot
product) is simply <span class="math inline">\(dr\)</span>. So we have:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    U &amp;= - \int_{\infty}^r \frac{kqq_0}{r^2} dr \\
    &amp;= - \bigg[ -\frac{kqq_0}{r} \bigg| _{\infty}^r \bigg] \\
    &amp;= k\frac{qq_0}{r}
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>which is our definition of electric potential energy.</p>
<h1 id="definition-of-electric-potential">Definition of Electric
Potential</h1>
<p>The electric potential, <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, at a
point is the electric potential energy a charge of 1 C would have were
it at that point. Like the electric field, the electric potential is a
field, it has a value everywhere in space. The electric potential is a
scalar field, and not a vector, and so we sometimes call it the scalar
potential.</p>
<p>The units of potential are Joules per Coulomb, J/C. Differences in
potential between two points, the potential difference, is sometimes
known as a voltage, and we then call this unit Volts, V. This is an
important concept in electrical circuits which you will learn about
later in PH322.</p>
<p>Using our definition of electric potential energy, and recalling
<span class="math inline">\(\vec{F} = q_0\vec{E}\)</span>, we have <span
class="math display">\[\Delta V = \frac{\Delta U}{q_0} = - \int_A^B
\vec{E}.d\vec{l}\]</span></p>
<p>As for electric potential energy, it is only the difference in
potential that matters, not the absolute value. So we are free to define
zero potential at any place we like. By convention we say the potential
is 0 at a point infinitely far away from the charge. So when we talk
about the potential at a point, this is really the potential difference
between that point and a point at infinity. So by analogy with the
derivation for electric potential energy, we can define the electric
potential at a distance <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> from a
point, known as the Coulomb potential:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span class="math display">\[V = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}
\frac{q}{|r|} = k \frac{q}{|r|}\]</span> Note that <span
class="math inline">\(|r|\)</span> is the magnitude of the distance,
i.e. <span class="math inline">\(|r| = |\vec{r}|\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<h1
id="relationship-between-electric-field-and-electric-potential">Relationship
between Electric Field and Electric Potential</h1>
<p>If we know the potential, then the electric field can be calculated
from:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{E} = -\nabla V = - \frac{\partial
V}{\partial x} \hat{i} - \frac{\partial V}{\partial y} \hat{j} -
\frac{\partial V}{\partial z} \hat{k}\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{i}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{j}\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{k}\)</span> are units vectors in the x, y and
z directions, respectively.</p>
</div>
<p>That is to say, the electric field pointing in any direction is the
derivative of the electric potential in that direction. This is possible
because, as we have said, electric field is a conservative vector field.
Mathematically, the meaning of a conservative vector field is that it
can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar field. In the case of the
electric field, this scalar field is the scalar potential.</p>
<p><strong><em>See Tipler/Mosca Examples 23-1 to 23-5,
23-7.</em></strong></p>
<h1 id="meaning-of-electric-potential">Meaning of Electric
Potential</h1>
<p>So, what does the potential actually mean? We can think of the
electrical potential at a point as the electrical potential energy that
a charge of 1C would have if it was sitting at that point. Or, more
strictly, it is the potential energy shared between the charge creating
the potential and this 1C test charge. However, just like how the
electric field has a meaning even when there is no test charge to feel
the electric force, the potential still has a meaning even when there
isn’t a charge to have the potential energy.</p>
<p>A difference from gravitational potential is that the electric
potential can either increase or decrease as we approach the source of
the field, depending on whether the source is positive or negative.</p>
<p>If the source of the field is a positive charge, then a positive test
charge is repelled. We have to do work to push the test charge towards
the source charge, and so it gains potential (just like a mass gains
potential energy if we do work to push it uphill.) If we are using the
convention that the potential at infinity is zero, then the potential
will be positive.</p>
<p>If the source of the field is a negative charge, then a positive test
charge is attracted. The test charges loses potential (just like a mass
loses potential energy as it rolls down a hill.) If we are using the
convention that the potential at infinity is zero, then the potential
will be negative.</p>
<p><strong><em>Non-examinable Aside:</em></strong> You might notice that
the electric potential, being a scalar, gives us only one ‘number’ for
each point in space, while the electric field, being a vector, gives us
three ‘numbers’. So how is it that the electric field can be calculated
from the electric potential, where does this extra information come
from? In turns out that, in electrostatics, one cannot simply have any
electric field distribution, there are only certain allowed electric
fields which allow us to define the electric potential in this way. That
is to say. if we simply chose our <span
class="math inline">\(E_x\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(E_y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(E_z\)</span> at random, this would almost
certainly not be a conservative field. To put it another way it is not
possible to create any arbitrary electric field distribution using only
static charges. Only conservative fields are created from static
charges, so we don’t have to worry about this in PH322. It turns out
that when we have a moving electric charges, or magnetic fields, then
the fields are not conservative, and can’t be described just by a scalar
potential - there is also a vector potential. In later courses you will
learn about this, and understand how it is encoded in Maxwell’s
Equations.</p>
<h1 id="lines-of-equipotential">Lines of Equipotential</h1>
<p>If we connect up points of equal potential, we get lines of
equipotential. These are somewhat analogous to contour lines on a map,
which join up points of equal altitude. If we move a charged particle
along a line of equipotential, it stays at the same potential. So it
does not gain or lose energy. Examples are shown in Figure 3.1. There is
an interesting relationship between electric field lines and lines of
equipotential. Field lines are always perpendicular to lines of
equipotential. So, if we go back to our contour lines on a map analogy,
electric field lines always point directly downhill. This will be
obvious once you have studied the meaning of the gradient of a scalar
field in PH312, it always points along the steepest slope of the field,
i.e. the direction of the electric field vector.</p>

<h1 id="super-position-principle-for-electric-potential">Super-Position
Principle for Electric Potential</h1>
<p>Potential obeys the super-position principle (which is unsurprising
if we think how it is related to the electric field). So the potential
from a collection of point charges is the sum of the potential from each
charge, and the potential from a continuous charge distribution is the
integral over the distribution. Some care is needed, remember that the
<span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> in the denominator is the
absolute value of the distance, it is not directional.</p>
<h1
id="electric-potential-from-continuous-charge-distributions">Electric
Potential from Continuous Charge Distributions</h1>
<p>Because electric potential obeys the super-position principle, we can
also sum the potential due to a collection of discrete charges or
integrate over a continuous charge distribution. This is actually easier
than for the electric field because potential is a scalar rather than a
vector.</p>

<p><em>Consider a rod of uniform charge density <span

<p>An element of length <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> has

where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is the position of the

is the distance to the point where we are calculating the potential. The

&lt;&lt; D\)</span>, then: <span class="math display">\[V = k \lambda
\ln [1+L/d] \approx k \lambda L/d = kQ/d\]</span></p>

</div>
<h2
id="electric-potential-from-an-infinite-plane-of-charge-non-examinable">Electric
Potential from an Infinite Plane of Charge (Non-Examinable)</h2>
<p>In Section 2.5.5 we calculated the electric field from an infinite
plane of charge to be <span class="math inline">\(2k\epsilon_0\)</span>.
This doesn’t depend on distance, <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>,
i.e. the electric field is the same everywhere. This is a problem if we
now try to calculate the potential since we want the integral: <span
class="math display">\[V = \int_{-\infty}^{r}E.d\vec{r}\]</span></p>
<p>which is unfortunately infinite.</p>
<p>This problems arises because of the way we chose our zero reference.
This is infinitely far away, but because normally the electric field
drops rapidly with distance and hence goes to zero at infinity, the line
integral over the field from infinity to our point of interest is
finite. But for the extreme case of an infinite plane of charge, the
electric field at infinity is still <span
class="math inline">\(2k\epsilon_0\)</span>.</p>
<p>In reality of course we never have an infinite plane of charge. If we
get far enough way from any finite plane of charge then it will start to
look like a point, the electric field will drop off as <span
class="math inline">\(1/r^2\)</span> and the integral will become finite
again. So this is not a real problem, it arises only because the
approximation we chose to use, that a finite plane of charge looks like
an infinite plane of charge when you are very close up, is a very bad
approximation once you get very far away.</p>
<p>Note also that we can still work out the potential difference between
two points in the field from an infinite plane of charge, the line
integral between any two points is finite. It’s just that it no longer
makes sense to choose a point an infinity as our reference 0 potential,
because the field at infinity no longer goes to zero.</p>
