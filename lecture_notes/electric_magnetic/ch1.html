<h1 class="title">Section 1 - Electric Charge and Coulombs's Law</h1>
<p class="author">Mike Hughes</p>
<p class="date">Physics and Astronomy, University of Kent</p>
</header>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Classical electromagnetic field theory is a description of the
interactions between electrical charges and electrical currents. The
theory was well-developed by the end of the nineteenth century, and yet
remarkably is consistent with the theory of special relativity. (In fact
you will recall from PH321 that it was electromagnetic theory which told
us we needed relativity!) Only in the limits of very small distances and
low field strengths does the theory begin to break down, in which case
we have to turn quantum electrodynamics, a relativistic quantum field
theory.</p>
<p>In this part of PH322 you will begin your study of classical
electromagnetism. We will study fundamental electrostatics - electric
fields generated by non-moving electrical charges - as well as taking a
brief look at magnetic fields. You can consider this section of PH322 to
be merely the first part of a three-module series (PH322 - PH504 -
PH604) which will develop classical electromagnetic field theory much
more fully, and give you a good understanding of Maxwell’s equations.
These equations completely describe the interactions between electric
and magnetic fields, but require mastery of the vector calculus you will
learn in PH312, and so will not be discussed at all in PH322.</p>
<h1 id="electric-charge">Electric Charge</h1>
<p>Electrical charge is a fundamental property of matter. It is has a
number of characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There are two types of charge: positive and negative.</p></li>
<li><p>Electrical forces are experienced between electrical
charges.</p></li>
<li><p>Like charges experience a repulsive force, unlike charges feel an
attractive force.</p></li>
<li><p>Electrical charge is measured in Coulombs (C). In SI units, 1 C =
1 Ampere-second (As).</p></li>
<li><p>Electrical charge is quantised, meaning it comes in discrete
chunks. The fundamental or elemental charge, which is also the magnitude
of the charge of an electron, is <span
class="math inline">\(1.6~\times~10^{-19}\)</span> C. All electrical
charges are integer multiples of the fundamental charge (except for
quarks which don’t appear in isolation and so we will ignore!)</p></li>
<li><p>Charge is conserved.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Non-examinable Aside:</strong> We can distinguish between
<em>local</em> and <em>global</em> charge conservation. Global charge
conservation says that, if I have a box and the total charge inside is
<span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> at some point in time, then at
some future point, the total charge inside the box is also <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>. This doesn’t preclude charge
disappearing at one point in the box and instantaneously appearing at
another point. In contrast, local charge conservation means that charge
does not appear and disappear, it can only flow between different
points. In the classical theory of electromagnetism, charge is
<strong>locally conserved</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="electrostatic-attraction-and-repulsion">Electrostatic Attraction
and Repulsion</h1>
<p>As described above, electrical charges experience attractive and
repulsive forces. However, we mostly don’t notice these electrical
forces. This is because, in most matter, the positive and negative
charges are almost exactly balanced. However, we can create slight
inbalances in many ways. The classic demonstration is to rub glass on
silk. A small number of electrons are transferred from the glass to the
silk. Electrons are negatively charged (with a charge of <span
class="math inline">\(-e\)</span> each) and so the glass gains a
positive charge and the silk a negative charge. The total charge is
unchanged.</p>
<h1 id="coulomb-force">Coulomb Force</h1>
<div class="definition">
<p>The force between two charged particles, with charges <span
class="math inline">\(q_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(q_2\)</span> and separated by a distance <span
class="math inline">\(r_{12}\)</span>, is given by Coulomb’s law. The
magnitude of the force, F, is: <span class="math display">\[F =
\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q_1q_2}{r_{12}^2}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_0\)</span> (‘epsilon
zero’) is the <strong>permittivity of free space,</strong> sometimes
known as the vacuum permittivity or the electric constant, <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon_0 \approx 8.85 \times
10^{-12}~\mathrm{C^2N^{-1}m^{-2}}\)</span>. The constant <span
class="math inline">\(1/(4\pi\epsilon_0)\)</span> is sometimes written
as <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, and called Coulomb’s
constant, <span class="math inline">\(k \approx 9 \times
10^9~\mathrm{Nm^2C^{-2}}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>While this provides the magnitude of the force, force is a vector and
hence also has a direction.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>The vector form of Coulomb’s law is: <span
class="math display">\[\vec{F}_{12}=
\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q_1q_2}{r_{12}^2}
\hat{r}_{12}\]</span></p>
<p>The expression <span class="math inline">\(\vec{F} _{12}\)</span>
means the force exerted by charge 1 on charge 2. Try to memorise which
way around this is to avoid notational confusion. Notice that the right
hand side now contains a unit vector, <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{r}_{12}\)</span>, which points from charge 1
to charge 2. As a unit vector (i.e. a vector of length 1) it has no
effect on the magnitude of the force, it just tells us the direction in
which the force acts.</p>
<p>We can simplify the equations if we write it in terms of Coulomb’s
constant, <span class="math inline">\(k = 1/(4\pi\epsilon_0)\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[\vec{F}_{12}= k\frac{q_1q_2}{r_{12}^2}
\hat{r}_{12}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>The unit vector <span class="math inline">\(\hat{r}_{12}\)</span> is
given by <span class="math display">\[\vec{r}_{12}=
\frac{\vec{r}_{12}}{|r_{12}|}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(|r_{12}|\)</span> is the length
(magnitude) of the vector <span class="math inline">\(r_{12}\)</span>.
Another way to write Coulomb’s Law is therefore: <span
class="math display">\[\vec{F}_{12}= k\frac{q_1q_2}{r_{12}^3}
\vec{r}_{12}\]</span></p>
<p>We can see that the direction also depends on the <em>sign</em> of
the charges. If <span class="math inline">\(q_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(q_2\)</span> are the same sign (both negative or
both positive) then <span class="math inline">\(q_1q_2\)</span> is
positive. So the force on charge 2 points along the direction of charge
1 to charge 2. That is, charge 2 feels a force repelling it from charge
1. On the other hand, if the signs are opposite then <span
class="math inline">\(q_1q_2\)</span> is negative and hence the force is
in the opposite direction to the unit vector, i.e. charge 2 feels a
force pulling it towards charge 1.</p>
<p>Also notice that it now matters whether we are calculating the force
on charge 1 due to charge 2, or the force on charge 2 due to charge 1.
While the magnitude of these two forces is the same, the
<em>direction</em> is opposite, i.e. <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{F}_{12} = -\vec{F}_{21}\)</span>. That is
because the unit vectors <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{r}_{12}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{r}_{21}\)</span> are not the same, they point
in opposite directions, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{r}_{12} =
-\hat{r}_{21}\)</span>. This makes sense - if we have two particles
which are attracted to each other, then the force on the left particle
points to the right, and the force on the right particle point to the
left.</p>
<p><strong>See Tipler/Mosca Examples 21-2, 21-3</strong></p>
<h1 id="superposition-principle">Superposition Principle</h1>
<p>Our study of electrostatics is greatly simplified by the
superposition principle. It says that the combined effect of two
charges, in terms of the force they exert on a third charge, is simply
equal to the sum of the forces each of the two charges individually
exert. This makes calculating the effect of multiple charges simple, we
just calculate the force due to each charge individually, and add them
up. However, we must add them as vectors - we care about the
direction!</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>The total force on a charge <span class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span>
from a collected of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> point charges
of charge <span class="math inline">\(q_i\)</span> is given by: <span
class="math display">\[\vec{F} = kq_0\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{q_i}{r_i^2}
\hat{r_i}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{r_i}\)</span> is the unit
vector pointing from the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th charge
to <span class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(r_i\)</span> is the distance between <span
class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span> and the <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th charge.</p>
</div>
<p>Note that this is a <strong>vector sum</strong>. We have to add the
components of the vectors to obtain another vector. We cannot simply add
the magnitudes of the of the forces. This is easily seen from a simple
example: if we have a force of 1 N pushing a charge to the right, and
another force of 1 N pushing the charge to the left, the total force is
not 2 N but 0 N (the forces are in opposite directions, so they
cancel).</p>
<p><strong>Non-examinable Aside</strong> - In certain media, known as
non-linear media, the superposition principle does not apply for very
high electric fields caused by, for example, intense laser light. This
leads to a branch of physics called non-linear optics which has lots of
useful and interesting applications, and is an active research field,
but sadly isn’t a topic for PH322.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><em>Consider two electric charges, <span class="math inline">\(q_1 =
1~\mathrm{nC}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q_2 =
4~\mathrm{nC}\)</span>, lying on a straight line at distances of 1 m and
6 m from the origin, respectively, as shown in Figure <a
href="#line_charge" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="line_charge">1</a></em>.</p>
<figure id="line_charge">
<p><img src="pictures/line_charge.png" style="width:5cm" alt="image" />
<span id="line_charge" data-label="line_charge"></span></p>
</figure>
<p>(a) <em>What is the force experienced by a charge of <span
class="math inline">\(q_0 = -2~\mathrm{nC}\)</span> lying 4 m from the
origin?</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{F} =
\frac{kq_1q_0}{r^2_{1,0}}\hat{r}_{1,0} +
\frac{kq_2q_0}{r^2_{2,0}}\hat{r}_{2,0}\]</span></p>
<p>The unit vector from <span class="math inline">\(q_1\)</span> to
<span class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{r}_{1,0}\)</span>, is along the +ve direction
of x-axis, and so <span class="math inline">\(\hat{r}_{1,0} =
\hat{i}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The unit vector from <span class="math inline">\(q_2\)</span> to
<span class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{r}_{2,0}\)</span>, is along the -ve direction
of x-axis, and so <span class="math inline">\(\hat{r}_{1,0} =
-\hat{i}\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        \vec{F} &amp;= \frac{kq_1q_0}{r^2_{1,0}}\hat{i} -
\frac{kq_2q_0}{r^2_{2,0}}\hat{i} \\
        &amp;= (9\times10^9~\mathrm{kgm^3s^{-2}C^{-2}})
\bigg(\frac{(1~\mathrm{nC})(-2~\mathrm{nC})}{(3~\mathrm{m}^2)} -
\frac{(4~\mathrm{nC})(-2~\mathrm{nC})}{(2~\mathrm{m})^2}\bigg)\hat{i} \\
        &amp;= 1.6 \times 10^{-8}\hat{i}~\mathrm{N}      
    
\end{aligned}\]</span> Note that the force is along the +ve direction.
<em>(b) Where should <span class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span> be placed
so that there is no net force?</em> We can see that this position will
be somewhere inbetween <span class="math inline">\(q_1\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(q_2\)</span>. <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        \vec{F} &amp;= \frac{kq_1q_0}{r^2_{1,0}}\hat{i} -
\frac{kq_2q_0}{r^2_{2,0}}\hat{i} \\
        0 &amp;= \frac{(1~\mathrm{nC})(-2~\mathrm{nC})}{(r_1-r_0)^2} -
\frac{(4~\mathrm{nC})(-2~\mathrm{nC})}{(r_2-r_0)^2} \\
        \frac{1}{[(1~\mathrm{m})-r_0]^2} &amp;=
\frac{4}{[(6~\mathrm{m})-r_0]^2} \\ %
    
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Solving this quadratic gives <span class="math inline">\(r_0 =
8/3~\mathrm{m}\)</span>. There is another mathematical solution at <span
class="math inline">\(r_0 = -4~\mathrm{m}\)</span> (i.e. another point
where <span class="math inline">\(|F_{20}| = |F_{10}|\)</span>), but
there the two forces are in the same direction and so they don’t
cancel.</p>
<p>Another way to see the answer is to note that force goes with <span
class="math inline">\(1/r^2\)</span> but linearly with <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span>. Since <span
class="math inline">\(q_2\)</span> is four times greater than <span
class="math inline">\(q_1\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(q_1\)</span> need to be <span
class="math inline">\(\sqrt{4} = 2\)</span> times closer to balance this
out. So, we have: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        \frac{r_2 - r_0}{r_0 - r_1} &amp;= 2 \\
        r_0 &amp;= 3/8~\mathrm{m}
        %
    
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p><em>Five charges are arranged as shown in Figure <a
href="#central_charge" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="central_charge">2</a>. What is the force on <span
class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span>?</em></p>
<figure id="central_charge">
<p><img src="pictures/central_charge.png" style="width:5cm"
alt="image" /> <span id="central_charge"
data-label="central_charge"></span></p>
</figure>
<p>The total force is given by: <span class="math display">\[\vec{F}_T =
\vec{F}_{1,0} + \vec{F}_{2,0} + \vec{F}_{3,0} +
\vec{F}_{4,0}\]</span></p>
<p>However, notice that <span class="math inline">\(\hat{r}_{1,0} =
-\hat{r}_{4,0}\)</span> and so <span class="math inline">\(\vec{F}_{1,0}
= -\vec{F}_{4,0}\)</span>. Similarly, <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{F}_{2,0} = -\vec{F}_{3,0}\)</span>. And so:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        \vec{F}_T = -\vec{F}_{4,0} -\vec{F}_{3,0} + \vec{F}_{3,0} +
\vec{F}_{4,0} = 0
    
\end{aligned}\]</span> And so the net force is zero. In fact this is
obvious from the symmetry of the problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p><em>Charge 1, <span class="math inline">\(q_1 = 3\)</span> nC, lies
at point (3,4) m and charge, <span class="math inline">\(q_2 =
-2\)</span> nC, lies at point (6,2) m. What is the force on charge 2 due
to charge 1?</em><br />
First write down the vector pointing from charge 1 to charge 2: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
      \vec{r}_{12} = (6-3)\hat{i}~\mathrm{m} + (2-4)\hat{j}~\mathrm{m} =
(3\hat{i} -2\hat{j})~\mathrm{m}
    
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The magnitude of this vector is: <span
class="math display">\[|\vec{r}_{12}| = \sqrt{(3~\mathrm{m})^2 +
(2~\mathrm{m})^2} = \sqrt{13} ~\mathrm{m}\]</span></p>
<p>And so the unit vector is: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        |\hat{r}_{12}| &amp;= \frac{ \vec{r}_{12}^2 } { |\vec{r}_{12}| }
~\mathrm{m} \\
        &amp;= \frac{ 3\hat{i} -2\hat{j} }{\sqrt{13}}
~\mathrm{m}            
    
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>We can then calculate the force: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        \vec{F}_{12} &amp;= k\frac{q_1q_2}{|\vec{r}_{12}^2|}
\hat{r}_{12} \\
        &amp;=
(9\times10^9)\frac{(3\times10^{-9})(-2\times10^{-9})}{|\vec{r}_{12}|^2}
\hat{r}_{12}~\mathrm{N} \\       
        &amp;= \frac{(-5.4 \times 10^{-8})}{(13)^{3/2}} (3\hat{i} - 2
\hat{j})~\mathrm{N} \\
        &amp;= (-3.5 \hat{i} + 2.3 \hat{j}) \times
10^{-9}~\mathrm{N}       
    
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
