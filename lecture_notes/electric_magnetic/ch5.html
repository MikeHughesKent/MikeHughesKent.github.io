<h1 class="title">Section 5 - Magnetic Fields</h1>

<p>Magnetic field are the second part of the electromagnetic field. In
later courses you will understand more about the origin of the magnetic
field, and how it is related to the electric field, but in PH322 we will
restrict ourselves to a description of how charged particles behave in
magnetic fields, and some applications of this.</p>
<h1 id="force-from-a-magnetic-field---lorentz-force">Force From a
Magnetic Field - Lorentz Force</h1>
<p>If we have a magnetic flux density, <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{B}\)</span>, then a charge <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span> moving at velocity <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{v}\)</span> in that field experiences a
force, <span class="math inline">\(\vec{F}\)</span> given by:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span class="math display">\[\vec{F} =
q\vec{v}\times\vec{B}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>This defines the unit of magnetic field, the Tesla (T). Note that the
magnetic flux density is sometimes known informally as the magnetic
field strength, although strictly this is <span class="math inline">\(H
= B/\mu_0\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\mu_0\)</span> is
the permeability of free space, <span class="math inline">\(4 \pi \times
10^{-7}\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[1 \mathrm{ T = 1 \frac{N/C}{m/s} = 1
\frac{N}{Am}}.\]</span></p>
<p>In practice we rarely experience fields anywhere near 1 T; the
magnetic field from the Earth is around <span
class="math inline">\(10^{-4}\)</span> T, an amount which is also known
as 1 Gauss (G). The magnets in modern Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
systems can reach a few Tesla, and require strict protections to prevent
magnetic materials entering the controlled area and being pulled in the
magnet.</p>
<p>Note that the force is the cross product of the velocity and the
field. So it is perpendicular to both, i.e. <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{F}.\vec{B} = 0\)</span>. A convenient way to
remember the direction in which the force points on a positive charge is
the <strong>Right Hand Rule</strong>, shown in Figure <a href="#rhr"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="rhr">1</a>. Curl your fingers
as if rotating the velocity vector into the magnetic field vector. Your
thumb then points in the direction of the force.</p>
<figure id="rhr">
<img src="pictures/rhr.png" style="width:8cm" />
<figcaption>Rule for direction of Lorentz force.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>See Tipler/Mosca Example 26-1.</strong></p>
<h1 id="work-done-by-a-magnetic-field">Work done by a Magnetic
Field</h1>
<p>Recall that the work done by a force is <span
class="math display">\[W=\int F. d\vec{r}\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(d \vec{r}\)</span> is the vector describing the
motion of the particle. But the magnetic force is always perpendicular
to the motion of the particle, i.e. <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{F}.\vec{dr} = 0\)</span>. So the magnetic
force does no work. This means it cannot change the kinetic energy of a
particle. Or, in other words, it changes the direction of the velocity,
but not the magnitude.</p>
<h1 id="magnetic-field-lines">Magnetic Field Lines</h1>
<p>Magnetic field lines are a similar concept to electric field lines,
but with important differences:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>While electric field lines have sources and sinks - electric
charges - there are no sources or sinks of magnetic field lines. A
magnetic has two poles - and these two poles always appear as a pair. If
we break a magnet in half, we end up with two magnets, each with two
poles. So magnetic field lines always form complete loops. They emerge
from the North pole end of the magnet and enter the South pole end
(although they don’t emerge or enter a point at the poles).</p></li>
<li><p>Magnetic field lines do not point in the direction of the Lorentz
force. The Lorentz force is perpendicular to the field lines.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="motion-in-a-magnetic-field">Motion in a Magnetic Field</h1>
<p>Consider a particle of charge <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>
and mass <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> moving on the x-y plane
of a cartesian co-ordinate system i.e. <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{v} = v_x\hat{i} + v_y\hat{j} + 0\hat{k} =
(v_x,v_y,0)\)</span>. There is a magnetic field pointing in the z
direction, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\vec{B} = 0\hat{i} +
0\hat{j} + B\hat{k} = (0,0,B)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The Lorentz force on the particle is given by: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\vec{F} &amp;= q\vec{v} \times \vec{B} \\
&amp;= q(v_yB\hat{i} - v_xB\hat{j})
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>As we expect, there is no <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{k}\)</span> component of the force. From
Newton’s Law, a force produces an acceleration, <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{F}=m\vec{a}\)</span>. So <span
class="math display">\[q(v_yB\hat{i} - v_xB\hat{j}) = m(a_x\hat{i} +
a_y\hat{j} + a_z\hat{k})\]</span> and so: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
a_x &amp;= qBv_y/m\\
a_y &amp;= -qBv_x/m\\
a_z &amp;= 0
\end{aligned}\]</span> You may recognise these as equations of motion
which describe circular motion. So the charged particle will follow a
circular path on the x-y plane. We can calculate the radius (<span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>) of this circular motion by making use
of the centripetal acceleration equation. Since the magnitude of the
velocity will not change (the magnetic field does no work) we can work
in terms of the magnitude of the velocity <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, and centripetal acceleration <span
class="math inline">\(a=v^2/r\)</span>. <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
a &amp;= \frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{qBv}{m} \\
r &amp;= \frac{mv}{qB}  \label{eq:1}
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The period, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, is then given by
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
T &amp;= \frac{2\pi r}{v} \\
T &amp;= \frac{2 \pi (mv/qB)}{v} = \frac{2 \pi m}{qB}
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>And the frequency, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, by <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
f &amp;= 1/T \\
f &amp;= \frac{qB}{2 \pi m}
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Note that the radius depends on the initial velocity, <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, while the period depends only on the
magnetic field strength, mass and charge. If there is an initial
velocity in the z direction then the particle will follow a helical
path.</p>
<p><strong>See Tipler/Mosca Example 26-4.</strong></p>
<h1 id="velocity-selector">Velocity Selector</h1>
<p>A velocity selector is an instrument which allows charged particles
(ions) with a specific velocity to be separated from particles with a
different velocity. It is often used with a mass spectrometer, as
discussed below.</p>
<p>Opposing electric and magnetic fields are set up in such a way that
they exactly balance each other for a specific velocity of the charged
particle, as shown in Figure <a href="#v_sel" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="v_sel">2</a>. The Coulomb force due to the electric
field from the charged plates is given by <span
class="math inline">\(F_E = qE\)</span>, and the Lorentz force due to
the magnets is given by <span class="math inline">\(F_B = qvB\)</span>.
Hence the two forces balance when <span
class="math inline">\(v=E/B\)</span>, and so only ions moving at this
velocity will be un-deflected and pass through the hole.</p>
<figure id="v_sel">
<img src="pictures/v_sel.png" style="width:12cm" />
<figcaption>Concept of a velocity selector. Opposing Lorentz and Coulomb
forces balance only for a specific velocity. Ions with a different
velocity will be deflected out of the beam.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h1 id="mass-spectrometer">Mass Spectrometer</h1>
<p>The mass spectrometer allows the mass of isotopes to be measured. It
exploits the result we derived above, which says that the radius of the
circular motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field depends on its
mass.</p>
<figure id="mass_spec">
<img src="pictures/mass_spec.png" style="width:15cm" />
<figcaption>Concept of a simple mass spectrometer. The radius of the
circular path of the ion in the magnetic field depends on its
mass.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A sample is vapourised and ionised (forming charged particles). The
ions are then accelerated by an electric field, across a potential of
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta V\)</span>. They therefore lose a
potential energy of <span class="math inline">\(q\Delta V\)</span> and
hence gain the same amount of kinetic energy. <span
class="math display">\[1/2 mv^2 = q\Delta V\]</span></p>
<p>The ions move into a magnetic field and so experience a Lorentz
force, moving in a circular path. Re-arranging the equation for the
radius of this path, <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, in terms of
<span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> and substituting this in, we
obtain <span class="math display">\[1/2 m\frac{r^2q^2B^2}{m^2} = q\Delta
V\]</span></p>
<p>We can write this in terms of the mass to charge ratio: <span
class="math display">\[\frac{m}{q} = \frac{B^2r^2}{2\Delta
V}\]</span></p>
<p>Therefore, by the location where the ion hits the detector, we know
the radius of its path and hence its mass-to-charge ratio. If we know
the charge on each ion, this allows us to calculate the mass. We can
select only ions with a certain charge using a velocity selector
(described above), since ions with a different charge will have
experienced a different acceleration due to the electric field, and so
be moving at a different velocity.</p>
<p>One application of mass spectrometry it to determine the ratios of
different isotopes in a material. For example, carbon dating is
performed by determining the ratio of Carbon-12 to Carbon-14.</p>
<p><strong>See Tipler/Mosca Example 26-5, 26-6.</strong></p>
<h1 id="cyclotron">Cyclotron</h1>
<p>A cyclotron is a type of particle accelerator. It can be used to
accelerate charged particles to high speed for use in scientific
experiments or as radiation sources for medical imaging.</p>
<figure id="cyc">
<img src="pictures/cyclotron.png" style="width:8cm" />
<figcaption>Concept of a simple cyclotron.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The simplest type of accelerator is a linear accelerator, in which an
electric field is used to accelerate a charged particle via the Coulomb
force. However, there is limit to the maximum potential difference which
can be created before the breakdown voltage of air is exceeded, and this
limits the velocities which can be created in a linear accelerator. In a
cyclotron, the same electric field is used multiple times.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure <a href="#cyc" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="cyc">4</a>, charged particles are injected in the middle
of the cyclotron, in the gap between the ‘D’s. An electric field
accelerates the charged particles, to the right in the case of the
diagram. Magnetic fields in the ‘D’s bring the particles in a circular
path back to the gap. The electric field is then switched, accelerating
the particles again, this time to the left. Again, the B-field causes
them to follow a circular path, although this time with a larger radius
(due to the larger velocity). This continues, with the particles
spiralling out, accelerating each time they cross the gap, until they
leave the cyclotron at high speed.</p>
<p>The final velocity and the radius of the outermost loop are linked by
Equation <a href="#eq:1" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:1">[eq:1]</a>. <span class="math display">\[r_{max} =
\frac{mv}{qB} \implies v = \frac{qBr_{max}}{m}\]</span> And so the
maximum possible velocity depends on both the strength of the B-field
and the size of the ‘D’s, but not on the accelerating potential
difference.</p>
