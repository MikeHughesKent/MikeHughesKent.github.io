<h1 class="title">Section 6 - Electromagnetic waves</h1>

</header>
<p>In this final section, we move to looking at wave phenomena in
electric and magnetic fields, otherwise known as electromagnetic
radiation or light. A full description of the propagation of light is a
complex endeavour, understanding it rigorously involves solving
Maxwell’s Equations. Here, we will look at some of the underlying
concepts of electromagnetic waves, relating to the physics of waves you
studied earlier in the module. We will also introduce the idea of
polarisation of light. Combined with the geometric optics studies in
PHYS3040, this will complete your introductory optics, which will be
built on later in PHYS6040.</p>
<h1 id="light-as-a-wave">Light as a Wave</h1>
<p>Light is a wave in the electromagnetic field (and so you should make
sure you are happy with the waves section of the module before
continuing). Later in your degree you will derive the wave equation from
Maxwell’s equations, but for now we will just begin with the wave
equation for the electric field in a vacuum. <span
class="math display">\[\frac{\partial^2 E(x,y,z,t)}{\partial x^2} +
\frac{\partial^2 E(x,y,z,t)}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2
E(x,y,z,t)}{\partial z^2} - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2
E(x,y,z,t)}{\partial t^2} = 0.\]</span> We can write a similar equation
for the magnetic field, but it turns out that the solutions are
essentially the same, so by convention we only work with the electric
field. Although you may not have studied vector calculus yet, and so we
will not use it here, you will often see this written more compactly as
<span class="math display">\[\nabla^2 E - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2
E}{\partial t^2} = 0.\]</span> The two equations mean the same thing (at
least in Cartesian co-ordinates), <span
class="math inline">\(\nabla^2\)</span> is a shorthand for taking the
sum of the 2nd order partial derivatives with respect to <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>. Notice that we have written
<span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and not <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span>, i.e. we are treating the field
as a scalar and not a vector. For this reason, the equation is sometimes
called the <em>scalar wave equation</em>. A full treatment would need to
use the vector form of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> which
makes things a lot more complicated and requires maths you may not have
seen yet.</p>
<p>However, we can cheat a little and only worry about the direction the
wave is travelling in, and align our co-ordinate system so that we call
this the z-axis. Then, working in 1D we have the simpler and more
familiar wave equation <span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial^2
E(z,t)}{\partial z^2} - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 E(z,t)}{\partial
t^2} = 0.\]</span> Now, it turns out that there are quite a lot of
solutions to this equation (and remember that any linear combinations of
solutions will also be solutions). A useful way to write the solutions
is as harmonic waves, <span class="math display">\[E(z) = A \sin(kz -
\omega t + \theta).\]</span></p>
<p>Depending on how far you have progressed with studying differential
equations this may or may not be obvious to you, but we can check it is
a solution by substituting it back into the left hand side of the 1D
wave equation.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \frac{\partial^2 E(z,t)}{\partial z^2} - \frac{1}{c^2}
\frac{\partial^2 E(z,t)}{\partial t^2} &amp;= \frac{\partial^2 \left( A
\sin(kz - \omega t + \theta) \right)}{\partial z^2} - \frac{1}{c^2}
\frac{\partial^2 \left( A \sin(kz - \omega t + \theta) \right)}{\partial
t^2} \\
    &amp;= Ak^2\sin(kz - \omega t + \theta) - \frac{1}{c^2} A\omega^2
\sin(kz- \omega t + \theta) \\
    &amp;= k^2 - \frac{\omega^2}{c^2}
\end{aligned}\]</span> There is no no <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> dependence, so this is a solution.
Setting equal to 0, as in the wave equation gives, <span
class="math display">\[c=\omega / k.\]</span></p>
<p>Since any linear combination of solutions is also a solution, we can
make all kinds of interesting solutions by taking sums of large numbers
of our sine-wave solutions with different values of <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. If we take an infinite number of
solutions we can even make a square-shaped wave! When you later study
Fourier transforms this will become more apparent, so we won’t dwell on
it for now.</p>
<p>Instead, let’s look at what the terms in the solution mean in more
detail. Like any wave, a light wave can be described in terms of its
amplitude (<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>), frequency (<span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span>), wavelength (<span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>), period (<span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span>), and initial phase (<span
class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>). We also define the wavenumber,
<span class="math inline">\(k = 2\pi/ \lambda\)</span> and the angular
frequency <span class="math inline">\(\omega = 2\pi f\)</span>, with
<span class="math inline">\(f = 1/T\)</span>. Note that since we have
shown <span class="math inline">\(c=\omega /k\)</span> we immediately
then get <span class="math inline">\(c = f \lambda\)</span>.</p>
<p>From the solution for <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> it is
clear that the field varies in both time and space, so when we draw a
wave we need to be clear what we are drawing - either the spatial wave
at a fixed point in time (<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>), or
the temporal wave at a fixed point in space (<span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>) (see Figure <a href="#waves"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="waves">1</a>).</p>
<figure id="waves">
<img src="pictures/waves.png" style="width:12cm" />
<figcaption>Light waves, viewed at a single point in space (left) and a
single point in time (right)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The argument of the <span class="math inline">\(\sin\)</span>
function is called the phase, <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>
where <span class="math display">\[\phi = kx - \omega t +
\theta,\]</span> and so <span class="math display">\[E = A
\sin(\phi).\]</span></p>
<p>This phase tells us the point in the wave cycle we have reached at
particular point in space and time. This is expressed as an angle, with
a phase of <span class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span> equivalent to a
complete cycle of the wave. After a phase of <span
class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span> we are back where we started, so for
example a phase of <span class="math inline">\(5\pi/2\)</span> is the
same as a phase of <span class="math inline">\(\pi/2\)</span>. Don’t
confuse the total phase (which is everything inside the sine) with the
initial phase, <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> which is an
offset to the phase.</p>
<p>Notice that we can write <span class="math display">\[k =
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z},\]</span> and, <span
class="math display">\[\omega = -\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial
t}  ,\]</span> which makes it explicit that wavenumber <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> tells us how the phase changes with
<em>position</em>, and the angular frequency <span
class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> tells us how the phase changes
with <em>time</em>.</p>
<h1 id="refractive-index-and-dispersion">Refractive Index and
Dispersion</h1>
<p>You will have come across refractive index already in the context of
geometrical optics, but now we can think about it in the context of the
wave theory of light. The velocity of light depends on the medium it is
travelling through. It can never exceed the speed of light in a vacuum,
<span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, that is to say it propagates
more slowly in other materials. The refractive index, <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, of that medium determines the
velocity.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>The refractive index, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, of a
medium is the inverse of the ratio of the speed of light in that medium,
<span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, to the speed of light in a
vacuum, <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[n=c/v\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>By definition, the refractive index of a vacuum is 1. Air is about
1.003, which we often take to be 1 for practical purposes. Water has a
refractive index of 1.4, and glass varies from 1.4-1.7.</p>
<p>From the solution to the wave equation in free space, we saw that
<span class="math display">\[v = c = \frac{\omega}{k},\]</span></p>
<p>or equivalently <span class="math display">\[v = c =
f\lambda,\]</span> which you can verify from <span
class="math inline">\(\omega = 2\pi f\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(k = 2\pi/\lambda\)</span>. When light enters a
medium with <span class="math inline">\(n &gt; 1\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(v &lt; c\)</span>. In which case either <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> must change. In fact it is the
wavelength, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, which changes
with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, so that <span
class="math display">\[\lambda_{medium} = n\lambda.\]</span> The
frequency and angular frequency, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>
or <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>, are fixed, and do not
depend on the refractive index of the medium.</p>
<p>For most materials, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> decreases
slightly with wavelength over the visible region. This gives rise to an
effect known as <strong>dispersion</strong>. Since different wavelengths
of light will travel at different speeds in the material, a short pulse
of multi-wavelength light will become spread out. This is the ultimate
limit on how much data can be sent over fibre optics. It also explains
how a spectrum is produced from a prism.</p>
<h1 id="phase-velocity-and-group-velocity">Phase Velocity and Group
Velocity</h1>
<p>Earlier in the module you will have discussed the difference between
phase velocity and group velocity. The velocity we are referring to
above is the phase velocity of light, and the refractive index, <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, tells us what happens to the phase
velocity.</p>
<p>If we have light of a single wavelength, then the phase velocity and
the group velocity are the same. But if we have light made up of
multiple wavelengths, then each wavelength will see a different
refractive index and so have a different phase velocity. The group
velocity is given by <span class="math display">\[v_g = \frac{d
\omega}{d k}.\]</span> In a non-dispersive material, i.e. where the
refractive index is constant with wavelength, then from <span
class="math inline">\(v = \omega/k\)</span> we can easily see that <span
class="math display">\[\frac{d \omega}{d k} = v\]</span> which is known
as linear dispersion. A particular example is a vacuum, in which case
<span class="math inline">\(v = c\)</span>.</p>
<p>More generally through, when <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
depends on <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(v_g \ne v\)</span>. A pulse of light, which for
reasons you will study more deeply later in your degree must be made up
of more than one wavelength of light, therefore has different group and
phase velocities, i.e. the pulse travels at a different speed. In some
special circumstances it is possible to have <span
class="math inline">\(v &gt; c\)</span>, but we always have that <span
class="math inline">\(v_g &lt;c\)</span>. Information travels at the
group velocity, not the phase velocity, and so this is consistent with
the theory of special relativity.</p>
<h1 id="wavefronts-and-huygens-principle">Wavefronts and Huygen’s
Principle</h1>
<p>It is often helpful to talk about the <strong>wavefront</strong> of a
wave. A wavefront is a surface of constant phase. The shape of the
wavefront can tell us how the light is propagating. For example, a
planar wavefront describes a <strong>collimated</strong> beam of light
(i.e. plane waves). A spherical wavefront describes light which is
converging from - or diverging to - a point.</p>
<p>If we have a point source, then the wavefront at a time <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is at a distance <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> from the point, where <span
class="math inline">\(r(t) = c t\)</span>. Here, <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is the speed of light in a vacuum. If
we working inside a material then we will need to modify this, as
described below.</p>
<p>Huygen’s principle provides a simple rule to predict the propagation
of a wavefront of light. It is empirical, in the sense that is was
derived by observations rather than than from any fundamental
considerations.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>Each point on a wavefront acts as source of secondary wavelets. These
wavelets have the same velocity and frequency as the original wave. The
envelope of these wavelets forms the new wavefront.</p>
</div>
<p>This says that if we have a wavefront, we can calculate how the
wavefront at some future point in time will look by assuming that each
point on the wavefront acts as a source of spherical waves. We then take
the envelope of these new waves, and that is now the new wave.</p>
<figure id="huygens">
<img src="pictures/huygens.png" style="width:12cm" />
<figcaption>Illustration of Huygen’s Principle of planar wave (left) and
spherical diverging wave (right)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Non-examinable Aside:</strong> Huygen had no explanation of
why this seemed to be true. In fact the reason can only be understood in
terms of a travelling wave solution to Maxwell’s equations, and in
particular the approximate description of this given by scalar
diffraction theory, which you will be introduced to in PHYS6040.</p>
<p>The flaw with Huygen’s principle is that it also suggests that there
is a wave running backwards, i.e. there is nothing to encode the
direction of the wave. This problem was later solved by Kirchhoff, but
that is beyond the scope of this course. Suffice it to say that
destructive interference results in the ‘backwards’ wave having zero
intensity.</p>
<h1 id="electromagnetic-spectrum">Electromagnetic Spectrum</h1>
<p>The frequency of electromagnetic radiation, or light, leads to
radically different interactions with the material world. The
electromagnetic spectrum is illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:emspec"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:emspec">3</a> below as a
function of frequency (or wavelength in a vacuum). We encounter
electromagnetic waves with frequencies spanning over 16 orders of
magnitude:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Gamma rays</strong> (<span class="math inline">\(f &gt;
10^{19}\)</span> Hz) are produced in nuclear and particle physics
processes. They are highly penetrating and cause damage to biological
tissue at moderate levels. They also have a number of applications in
medical imaging (PET, SPECT cameras) and medical radiotherapy (such as
Iodine therapy).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>X-rays</strong> (<span
class="math inline">\(10^{16}~\mathrm{Hz} &lt; f &lt;
10^{20}~\mathrm{Hz}\)</span>) overlap gamma rays in terms of frequency,
but are generally distinguished by the method of production - x-rays are
emitted from outside the nucleus, such as electrons in orbitals or rapid
deceleration of atom. Again they are highly penetrating but easier to
produce and work with than gamma rays, and so they are widely used in
medical and industrial imaging</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ultraviolet rays</strong> (<span
class="math inline">\(7.5\times10^{14}~\mathrm{Hz} &lt; f &lt;
4\times10^{16}~\mathrm{Hz}\)</span>) are present in sunlight and, while
non-ionising, can cause damaging to living tissue. Exposure of human
skin is associated with an increased risk of skin cancer, while
short-wavelength UV light can be used to sterilise surfaces. Longer
wavelength UV light can be used to excite fluorescence in some
molecules.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Visible light</strong> (<span
class="math inline">\(4.3\times10^{14}~\mathrm{Hz} &lt; f &lt;
7.5\times10^{14}~\mathrm{Hz}\)</span>), while a small part of the
spectrum, is the most obvious form of EM radiation and the only part of
the spectrum directly detectable by the eye. Blue light is at the
shorter wavelength end, red light is at the longer wavelength
end.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Infrared Light</strong> (<span
class="math inline">\(3\times10^{11}~\mathrm{Hz} &lt; f &lt;
4.3\times10^{14}~\mathrm{Hz}\)</span>) is emitted by a black body near
room temperature, and so has applications in thermal imaging. It has
many other applications such as in astronomy and communications (e.g.
your TV remote control).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Microwaves</strong> (<span
class="math inline">\(3\times10^{9}~\mathrm{Hz} &lt; f &lt;
3\times10^{11}~\mathrm{Hz}\)</span>) are widely used in communications
and related applications, as well as for cooking in a microwave oven (at
2.45 GHz)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Radio waves</strong> (<span
class="math inline">\(3\times10^{3}~\mathrm{Hz} &lt; f &lt;
3\times10^{9}~\mathrm{Hz}\)</span>) are again very widely used for
communications, and also feature prominently in astronomy.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="polarisation">Polarisation</h1>
<p>Light is a <strong>transverse wave</strong>, the electric field (and
the magnetic field) is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of
the light. In <strong>linearly polarised light</strong>, the E-field
points negative or positive along a single direction. In
<strong>circularly polarised light</strong>, the direction of the
electric field rotates as the light propagates. In elliptically
polarised light the amplitude of the wave varies as the direction
rotates. <strong>Unpolarised light</strong> is made of up of fields
pointing in all directions.</p>
<p>Unpolarised light can be linearly polarised using a polariser such as
polarising film. The film has a transmission axis, which is the
orientation of polarisaton of light which will be transmitted. If the
incident light is unpolarised then the transmitted light will be
polarised in the same direction as the transmission axis. The incident
light will be attenuated by a factor of 2, i.e. half the intensity is
lost.</p>
<p>However, if the incident light is already linearly polarised before
it hits the polariser then the fraction of light which will be
transmitted is given by Malus’ Law:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{I_{transmitted}}{I_{incident}} =
\cos^2 \theta\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>
is the angle between the incident polarisation direction and the
transmission axis. If two polarisers are placed at 90 degrees to each
other, known as ‘crossed polarisers’ then the transmitted intensity is
zero.</p>
<p>Note that Malus’s Law doesn’t work for unpolarised light. Unpolarised
light will be polarised along the axis of the polariser with a loss of
half its intensity.</p>
<figure id="pol">
<img src="pictures/pol.png" style="width:12cm" />
<figcaption>Polarisation. The first polariser creates linearly polarised
light. The second polariser changes the angle of polarisation, and also
reduces the intensity</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>An interesting consequence of Malus’s Law is illustrated in the
following. Consider an initial situation with two polarisers, set up
with their axes at <span class="math inline">\(90^o\)</span> to each
other (crossed polarisers). Unpolarised light hits the first polariser
and is then linearly polarised along the axis of the polariser. When it
strikes the second polariser, we then have <span
class="math inline">\(\theta = 90^o\)</span> and so the transmitted
intensity is 0.</p>
<p>Now imagine inserting a third polariser between the initial two. We
orient this polariser so that the axis is at <span
class="math inline">\(45^o\)</span> to the first polariser (and so also
at <span class="math inline">\(45^o\)</span> to the second).</p>
<p>The angle between the light polarised by the first polariser, with
intensity (<span class="math inline">\(I_1\)</span>) and the axis of the
second polariser is <span class="math inline">\(45^o\)</span> and so:
<span class="math display">\[I_2 = I_1 \cos^2(\theta) = I_1\cos^2(45^o)
= 0.5I_1\]</span> Now, when this light hits the final polariser, again
we have <span class="math inline">\(\theta = 45^o\)</span>, <span
class="math display">\[I_3 = I_2 \cos^2(\theta) = I_2\cos^2(45^o) =
0.5I_2 = 0.25I_1\]</span> So by inserting an additional polariser we
have increased the amount of light making it through the system!</p>
<p>These kind of effects are strongly associated with wave phenomena,
and are require more elaborate explanations if we try to explain light
as a stream of classical particles. But what is even more interesting is
that we get the same result even if we work with individual photons, at
which point we are straying into quantum mechanics (and quantum optics),
which will have to wait for now!</p>
