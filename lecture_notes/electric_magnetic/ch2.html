<h1 class="title">Section 2 - Electric Field</h1>

<p>Using Coulomb’s law, and the superposition principle, we can now
calculate the force from any distribution of charges. (At least in
principle, if we can do the integral!) However, we will see that in many
cases it makes sense to define something called an electric field. The
electric field is an example of a vector field.</p>
<h1 id="vector-fields">Vector Fields</h1>
<p>You are familiar with the idea of scalars and vectors. A scalar
quantity has only magnitude, examples are temperature and mass. A vector
quantity has both magnitude and direction, examples are velocity and
force.</p>
<p>A <strong><em>scalar field</em></strong> means that for each point in
space, we have a number. An example from everyday experience would be
the temperature on a weather map. At each point, we define a single
number, which is the temperature at that point. While a weather map
might only show the temperatures at a few points, in principle this
field is continuous, we can specify the temperature at points
arbitrarily finely.</p>
<p>A <strong><em>vector field</em></strong> has a magnitude and a
direction for each point in space. The corresponding example of a vector
field is the wind map. Here the map shows the strength of the wind (the
magnitude of the wind vector) but also its direction. This is usually
done using arrows, with the length of the arrow telling us the strength
of the wind at the point at the start of the arrow, and the direction of
the arrow telling us the direction of the wind at that point. Again,
while we can only draw arrows at a limited number of places (to stop
them being on top of each other), the wind speed and direction can be
defined everywhere.<br />
<strong>Non-examinable Aside</strong> - You might wonder whether the
electric field is a real physical ‘thing’. After all, can’t we just
think in terms of forces between charges - if there is no charge present
to feel a force due to the electric field, then does the field have any
residual meaning? In electrostatics, where we have electric fields due
to eternal, non-moving electric charges, this is a reasonable arguments,
but in later courses where you study electrodynamics, and find electric
fields hanging around long after the charges which created them have
left the shop, we find it really does make more sense to think in terms
of fields.</p>
<h1 id="definition-of-electric-field">Definition of Electric Field</h1>
<p>The electric field can be thought of as the electrical force which
would be experienced by a 1C charge (although it is really more
fundamental than this rather pedestrian definition). Hence:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>The magnitude of the electric field a distance <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> from a point charge of <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is given by: <span
class="math display">\[E=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{r^2}\]</span>
As for the electric force, this is really a vector quantity: <span
class="math display">\[\vec{E}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{r^2}\hat{r}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is a unit vector pointing
from the charge <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> to the point
where we are determining the electric field. The force, <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{F}\)</span>, on a charge, <span
class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span>, placed at this point is then: <span
class="math display">\[\vec{F}=q_0\vec{E}\]</span></p>
</div>
<h1 id="motion-in-an-electric-field">Motion in an Electric Field</h1>
<p>A particle of charge <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>
experiences a force of <span class="math inline">\(q\vec{E}\)</span>.
From <span class="math inline">\(F=ma\)</span>, this tells us that if
that particle has a mass of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, it
will experience an acceleration of: <span class="math display">\[\vec{a}
= \frac{q}{m}\vec{E}\]</span></p>
<p>This allows the charge-to-mass ratio of the particle in a known
electric field to be determined by measuring its acceleration. There is
a classic experiment, first performed by J.J.Thompsin in 1897, in which
the charge to mass ratio of electrons is calculated, although to do this
correctly is is also necessary to make some relativistic
corrections.</p>
<p><strong>See Tiper/Mosca Examples 21-11, 21-12.</strong></p>
<h1 id="superposition-principle-for-electric-field">Superposition
Principle for Electric Field</h1>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(\vec{F}=q_0\vec{E}\)</span>, the
superposition principle also holds for electric field. Hence:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>The total electric field due to a collection of <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> point charges of charge <span
class="math inline">\(q_i\)</span> is given by: <span
class="math display">\[\vec{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\sum_{i=1}^{N}
\frac{q_i}{r_i^2} \hat{r_i} = k\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{q_i}{r_i^2}
\hat{r_i}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{r_i}\)</span> is the unit
vector pointing from the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th charge
(<span class="math inline">\(q_i\)</span>) to the point where we
calculate the field, and <span class="math inline">\(r_i\)</span> is the
distance between <span class="math inline">\(q_i\)</span> and the point
where we calculate the field.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>See Tiper/Mosca Examples 21-6, 21-7, 21-8, 21-9.</strong></p>
<h1 id="electric-field-lines">Electric Field Lines</h1>
<p>Electric field lines are a way of representing an electric field
visually. Recall that an electric field is a vector field, so we need to
represent both the amplitude and the direction at different points in
space. One way to represent an electric field might be to draw lots of
different arrows, with the direction the arrow is pointing representing
the direction of the field, and the length of the arrow the strength of
the field. The electric field is defined everywhere in space, and so to
represent it fully we would need arrows starting everywhere, but of
course then they would overlap and we would just have a black box, which
wouldn’t tell us very much. So we can only represent the field at some
discrete points. Incidentally, this is exactly how the vector field of
wind is often represented on a weather map.</p>
<p>However, this is not the way we normally represent electric fields.
Instead we use field lines. You can imagine a field line as being what
you get when you join up a line of arrows. Once we do this we can no
longer tell how long the arrows were and hence how strong the field is.
Instead, we use the density of the lines to tell us the field strength.
Examples are shown in Figure <a href="#field_lines"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="field_lines">1</a>. When
drawing field lines we observe the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Field lines begin at positive charges and end at negative
charges.</p></li>
<li><p>At the point where they enter or exit a charge, the lines are
symmetric.</p></li>
<li><p>Field lines cannot start or end in free space. (You may have some
apparently ending at the edge of the diagram, but that’s just because
the diagram isn’t big enough).</p></li>
<li><p>The density of the lines gives an indication of the strength of
the field at that point (in a 3D diagram it is proportional).</p></li>
<li><p>The direction of the electric field is tangent to the field
lines.</p></li>
<li><p>A positively charged particle will experience a force in the
direction of the field line. (A negatively charged particle will feel a
force in the opposite direction).</p></li>
<li><p>Field lines can never cross.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>  Things field lines are not:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Field lines do not tell us the path a charged particle would
follow in the electric field, only the direction and magnitude of the
force acting on the particle when it is at that pint (which if you think
about it is not the same thing at all. If it’s not obvious think about
an object orbiting the Earth - the force is central but the motion is
not.)</p></li>
<li><p>In a 2D representation, a quantitative representation of the
strength of the electric field.</p></li>
