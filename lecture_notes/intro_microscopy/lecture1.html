<h1 id="simple-microscopes">Simple Microscopes</h1>
<p>In this section we will review some fundamental concepts from
geometrical optics which will already be familiar to most, and begin
thinking about the design of a simple microscope.</p>
<h2 id="the-thin-lens">The Thin Lens</h2>
<p>A lens is piece of glass or plastic with one or both of its surfaces
curved in such a way as to cause light rays to converge or diverge due
to refraction. In what is follows, we use the <strong>thin lens
approximation</strong>, which ignores the thickness of the lens. In
which case, the locations of the object (<span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span>) and image (<span
class="math inline">\(s&#39;\)</span>), see Fig. <a href="#lens"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="lens">1</a>, for a lens are
linked to the focal length of the lens, <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, by the <strong>lens
equation:</strong></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{s} +
\frac{1}{s&#39;}\]</span> If we have a lens of focal length <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, and we place an object a distance of
<span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> one side of the lens, we obtain
an image a distance <span class="math inline">\(s&#39;\)</span> the
other side of the lens.</p>
<p><strong>Note that <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(s&#39;\)</span> are both measured from the lens
outwards</strong> (i.e. in a system such as that shown in Fig. <a
href="#lens" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="lens">1</a>,
where the object is to the left of the lens, <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is measured from right to left and
<span class="math inline">\(s&#39;\)</span> is measured from left to
right.) An object to the left of the lens has a positive <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and an image to the right of the lens
has a positive <span class="math inline">\(s&#39;\)</span>. This is
called the <strong>Gaussian co-ordinate system</strong>. An alternative
system, the Cartesian co-ordinate system, measures everything from left
to right which is useful when dealing with some kinds of systems. In
this system, the lens equation would have a minus sign before the <span
class="math inline">\(1/s&#39;\)</span> term.</p>
<p>The focal length <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is fixed for
a given lens, it depends on the curvature of its surface according to
the <strong>lens makers’ equation</strong>: <span
class="math display">\[\frac{1}{f}
=(n-1)\bigg(\frac{1}{r_1}-\frac{1}{r_2} \bigg)\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(r_1\)</span> is the radius of
curvature of the first surface of the lens, <span
class="math inline">\(r_2\)</span> is the radius of curvature of the
second surface, and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the
refractive index of the lens material.</p>
<figure id="lens">
<img src="figs/thinlens2.png" style="width:10cm" />
<figcaption>Notation for the the lens. Focal length is denoted by <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A real image is obtained for <span class="math inline">\(s &gt;
f\)</span>. Otherwise there will be no real image, and <span
class="math inline">\(s&#39;\)</span> is negative, with rays appearing
to diverge from a virtual image at <span
class="math inline">\(s&#39;\)</span> (i.e. on the left side of the
lens, as drawn).</p>
<p>The linear magnification, the ratio of the size of the image to the
size of the object, <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, is given by
<span class="math display">\[M = -\frac{s&#39;}{s}\]</span></p>
<p>The minus sign tells us that the image is inverted.</p>
<h2 id="simple-magnifier">Simple magnifier</h2>
<p>Let’s consider the eye to be a simple imaging system, consisting of a
thin converging lens (eye lens and cornea) and a screen (the retina).
The distance from the lens to the retina is fixed, but the focal length
of the thin lens, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, can be changed
by the muscles in the eye (known as accommodation). If the object has
size <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> then the size of the image
on the retina, <span class="math inline">\(y&#39;\)</span>, depends on
the object’s distance from the lens, <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> as shown in Figure <a href="#eye"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eye">2</a>.</p>
<p>Under the paraxial approximation, an object of size <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> subtends an angle <span
class="math inline">\(\theta = y/s\)</span>. In principle we can make an
object as big as we like by bringing it arbitrarily close the lens.
However, this requires <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to be
adjusted, and there is a limit to how far the eye can accommodate. The
closest an object can be brought and still focused on the retina is
called the <strong>near point</strong> of the eye, and is comfortably
around <span class="math inline">\(x_{np} = 25\)</span> cm for a healthy
eye. The angle subtended by the object is approximately <span
class="math inline">\(y/x_{np}\)</span>.</p>
<figure id="eye">
<img src="figs/eye.png" style="width:14cm" />
<figcaption>Left: A simple model of the eye as a converging lens. Right:
Use of a converging lens as a simple magnifier. The magnifier allows the
object to be brought closer than the near point of the eye, increasing
the angle it subtends and hence making it appear larger.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A simple magnifier is a converging lens placed in front of the eye
lens, with an object we wish to view placed at the focal length of the
lens. The lens makes the object appear as though it is at infinity. The
eye can then fully relax, as it is when accommodated to view objects at
infinity, but the image size on the retina is the same as if the object
was placed at <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. That is to say
that the angle subtended by the object, <span
class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is the same. Since this angle is
now given by <span class="math inline">\(y/f\)</span>, we can write the
angular magnification of the magnifier as <span class="math display">\[M
= \frac{x_{np}}{f}\]</span></p>
<p>This is also the ratio of the size of the object on the retina when
viewed through the magnifying glass, at a distance of <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, compared to the size if we viewed it
without the magnifying glass, when we would need to move the object out
to the near point, <span class="math inline">\(x_{np}\)</span></p>
<h2 id="the-compound-microscope">The compound microscope</h2>
<p>Consider an ideal thin lens of focal length, <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. Recall that an object at infinity is
imaged a distance <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> behind the
lens. If an object is placed a distance <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> in front of the lens, it will be imaged
a distance <span class="math inline">\(s&#39;\)</span> behind the lens,
where <span class="math display">\[1/f = 1/s + 1/s&#39;,\]</span> with a
linear magnification, <span class="math inline">\(M =
-s&#39;/s\)</span></p>
<p>For a thin aberration-free lens in geometrical optics we can obtain
arbitrarily high magnification through our choice of <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, and if we place a camera at the
position of the image, we have a microscope.</p>
<p>More traditional compound microscopes, where we can look directly at
the image, require an extra element called an eye-piece. This is because
the image formed by the objective is still quite small, to get it to
fill a decent portion of the eye’s angular field of view we would have
to get very close to it, closer than the near point. The job of the
eyepiece is to take the image and make it appear as though it is at
infinity, allowing our eyes to relax - the same job as the simple
magnifier. This is done by placing the eyepiece so that the image of the
object is at its focal length, <span class="math inline">\(f_e\)</span>.
This is shown in Figure <a href="#microscope" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="microscope">3</a></p>
<figure id="microscope">
<img src="figs/microscope.png" style="width:14cm" />
<figcaption>Simple diagram of a compound microscope. The objective, on
the left, forms a magnified image of the object. The eyepiece allows
this image to be viewed at infinity.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For the objective, of focal length <span
class="math inline">\(f_o\)</span>, the linear magnification is given by
<span class="math inline">\(-s&#39;/s\)</span>. However, we may also
write this magnification as approximately: <span
class="math display">\[M = -\frac{L}{f_o}\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is the distance between the focal
points of the objective and the eye-piece. This is called the
<strong>tube length</strong>. This approximation is valid because we
typically want a large magnification, and so <span
class="math inline">\(s&#39; \gg s\)</span>. This means that the object
is quite close to the focal point, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(s
\approx f_o\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(L\gg f_o\)</span>
such that <span class="math inline">\(L \approx s&#39;\)</span>.</p>
<p>The magnification of the entire microscope includes the angular
magnification of the eyepiece (<span
class="math inline">\(x_{np}/f_e\)</span>) and so the total
magnification is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[M =
-\frac{L}{f_o}\frac{x_{np}}{f_e}\]</span></p>
<p>In practice, we find the resolution of this microscope would be very
poor. We will see shortly that the ultimate limit on resolution is given
by the numerical aperture of the lens. However, in practice, as we
increase the numerical aperture of simple spherical lens, we find that
the image resolution is instead limited by optical aberrations. Using an
aspheric lens it’s possible to minimise aberrations on-axis, but it
isn’t possible to design a single surface lens which provides high
resolution across a meaningful field of view.</p>
<h1 id="the-microscope-objective">The Microscope Objective</h1>
<p>Practical objectives are multi-element, i.e. they contain multiple
surfaces which are optimised to minimise aberrations. For colour, or
multi-wavelength imaging, they must also be achromatic (i.e. different
wavelengths are focused to the same point) and flat-field, meaning that
the in-focus image is formed on a plane, and not a curved surface.
Generally, the more you are willing to pay, the better these correction
will be. There are a bizarre (for historical reasons) set of names for
the different levels of correction available, which you can read all
about here:</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.olympus-lifescience.com/en/microscope-resource/primer/anatomy/specifications/">https://www.olympus-lifescience.com/en/microscope-resource/primer/anatomy/specifications/</a></p>
<p>An important distinction is between <em>finite conjugate</em> and
<em>infinite conjugate</em> objectives:</p>
<p><strong>Finite Conjugate:</strong> An objective designed to form an
image directly on the camera. Objectives are designed for the camera to
be placed at a specific distance (<span
class="math inline">\(s&#39;\)</span>), usually either 160 mm (DIN
standard) or 180 mm (RIS standard). Of course, you can form an image at
different distances, providing you also change the distance to the
object, <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, but the corrections
won’t be as good. Objectives are specified in terms of their
magnification, such as x10, or x40, and you only obtain this
magnification with the camera placed at the correct distance. For direct
visualisation of the image, an eyepiece is also required. This also has
a magnification specified, and the total magnification is given by the
product of the two.</p>
<p><strong>Infinite Conjugate:</strong> An infinite conjugate microscope
objective is designed to be used with the object placed at the focal
length, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, and so form an image at
infinity. They therefore require a second lens, known as tube lens, to
form an image on the camera. These objectives are again specified by
magnification, but now this depends on using a tube lens of the
specified focal length. There is also usually a range of tube lengths
(distance between the objective and the tube lens) which are
recommended. Some infinite conjugate objectives are designed to work
with a specific tube lens in order for the correct aberration correction
to be achieved.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages of infinite conjugate objectives:</strong>
Elements with optical thickness (such as filters and beamsplitters) can
be placed in the optical path without affecting the magnification.
Infinite conjugate objectives are also needed in scanning laser systems
such as confocal microscopes (more on this in lecture 3).</p>
<h1 id="the-condenser">The Condenser</h1>
<p>The condenser is the element used to illuminate the sample. The
condenser has an important role to play in resolution, as discussed
later, the theoretical resolution of a transmission microscope cannot be
achieved if the numerical aperture does not match the numerical aperture
of the objective. In some configurations, illumination light is sent
through the objective, in which case the objective and the condenser are
one and the same.</p>
<h1 id="contrast">Contrast</h1>
<p>To observe features in a sample there must be some difference in
intensity or colour between those features and other areas of the image.
The contrast depends not only on the sample, but on the design of the
microscope and illumination.</p>
<p><strong>Brightfield:</strong> Most simple microscopes operative in
bright field transmission mode. The sample is illuminated from the back,
and we obtain contrast because the sample absorbs or (to a lesser
extent) scatters light. Of course the sample must be at least partly
transparent, or we simply obtain a silhouette. This type of microscope
therefore cannot image thick samples. Samples are often stained in order
to selectively increase absorption. A common staining protocol used in
histology is H&amp;E (Hematoxylin and Eosin) which stains components of
tissue various shades of blue, violet and red.</p>
<p><strong>Darkfield:</strong> When absorption cannot provide sufficient
contrast, particularly for unstained samples (e.g. live samples),
<strong>darkfield microscopy</strong> may sometimes be used. In this
case, the sample is illuminated at a high angle of incidence, such that
undeflected light cannot reach the objective. We therefore only see
light which is scattered by the sample, and the background is dark.</p>

class="uri">https://www.olympus-lifescience.com/en/microscope-resource/primer/techniques/darkfieldindex</span></a></p>
<p><strong>Fluorescence Microscopy:</strong> When certain molecules,
called fluorophores, absorb light of certain wavelength, they re-emit
light at a longer wavelength. The difference between the excitation and
emission wavelengths is called the Stoke’s shift. Physically, an
incident photon excites an electron to a higher energy level. It then
relaxes to a slightly lower level via internal energy transfer
processes, before re-emitting and dropping back down to the original
level. Since the drop is now a smaller change in energy, the emitted
photon is lower energy and so has a longer wavelength.</p>
<p>When a sample is naturally fluorescent, we call this
<em>intrinsic</em> or <em>auto</em>fluorescence. More often, we apply
fluorescent stains or generically engineer an organism to contain
fluorescent proteins.</p>
<p>To image fluorescene we introduce a fluorecence filter set. The
excitation filter ensures we illuminate the sample only with the correct
excitation wavelength, and the emission filter selects only the
fluorescent emission. Without the use of filters, the fluorescence
emissions would be drowned out by the excitation light hitting the
camera.</p>
<p>The direction of the emitted photon is random and doesn’t depend on
the direction the excitation came from. So there is no distinction
between bright-field and dark-field imaging. Fluorescence microscopy is
often performed in <em>epi</em> configuration, meaning that the sample
is excited from the sample side as it is imaged, via the same objective.
A dichroic mirror, which reflects light below a certain threshold
wavelength and transmits light above this threshold (or vice versa) is
then used to separate the excitation and emission optical paths.</p>
